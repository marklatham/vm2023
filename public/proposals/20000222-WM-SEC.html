              <p>February 22, 2000</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>Response of the Office of Chief Counsel<br />
                              </strong><strong><u>Division of Corporation Finance</u></strong></p>
              <p>Re: Washington Mutual, Inc.<br />
                Incoming letter dated December 15, 1999</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The proposal would mandate that Washington Mutual hire a      proxy advisory firm, to be chosen by shareholder vote, to      make shareholder voting recommendations.</p>
              <p>There appears to be some basis for your view that      Washington Mutual may exclude the proposal under rule      14a-8(i)(1) as an improper subject for shareholder action      under applicable state law. It appears, however, that this      defect could be cured if the proposal were recast as a      recommendation or request rather than as a mandate.      Accordingly, unless the proponent provides Washington Mutual      with a proposal revised in this manner, within seven calendar      days after receiving this letter, we will not recommend      enforcement action to the Commission if Washington Mutual      omits the proposal from its proxy materials in reliance on      rule 14a-8(i)(1).</p>
              <p>We are unable to concur in your view that Washington      Mutual may exclude the proposal under rule 14a-8(i)(7).      Accordingly, we do not believe that Washington Mutual may      omit the proposal from its proxy materials in reliance on      rule 14a-8(i)(7).</p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>
              <p>Michael Ferraro,<br />
                Attorney-Advisor</p>
