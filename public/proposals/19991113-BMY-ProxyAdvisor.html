		    <p><em>Shareowner proposal submitted to Bristol-Myers Squibb on November 13, 1999:</em></p>
		    <hr />
		    <h3><strong>HIRE PROXY ADVISORY FIRM CHOSEN BY  SHAREOWNER VOTE</strong></h3>
		    <blockquote>
              <p>WHEREAS many shareowners lack the time and expertise to      make the best voting decisions, yet prefer not to always      follow management&rsquo;s recommendations because of      management&rsquo;s possible conflicts of interest;</p>
		      <p>WHEREAS proxy advisory firms have established reputations      for giving sound independent advice to many institutional      investors on how to vote their shares;</p>
		      <p>WHEREAS shareowners have a common interest in obtaining      sound independent advice, but often insufficient private      interest to justify paying for it individually (the      &quot;free-rider&quot; problem);</p>
		      <p>THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Company hire a proxy      advisory firm for one year, to be chosen by shareowner vote. Bristol-Myers Squibb shareowners request the      Board of Directors to take all necessary steps to enact this      resolution in time to hold the vote at the year-2001      shareowner meeting, with the following features:</p>
		      <p>To insulate advisor selection from influence by Company      management, any proxy advisory firm can put itself on the      ballot by paying an entry fee and declaring the price (no      more than $10,000) for its advisory service for the coming      year. The winning candidate is paid its declared price by the      Company, and is expected to make voting advice freely      available to all Company shareowners for the subsequent year.      Fulfillment of that expectation is not policed by Company      management, but rather by loss of reputation and future      business if performance is disappointing.</p>
		      <p>The decision of whether to hire proxy advisory firms in      later years is left open, and can be decided by future      shareowner votes.</p>
		      <p><u>Supporting Statement:</u></p>
		      <p>This proposal can be expected to improve the return on Bristol-Myers Squibb stock by:</p>
		      <blockquote>
                <p>- enhancing management accountability to shareowners          by making professionally researched advice available to          all;</p>
		        <p>- effectively enfranchising individual investors for          the first time, ensuring that a majority of shares can be          voted independently of management&rsquo;s recommendations;</p>
		        <p>- encouraging greater competition among advisory firms          to serve shareowner interests;</p>
		        <p>- reducing the cost to shareowners of voting advice,          which is already being paid by pension funds on a          subscription basis. (The same advice will be bought as a          group purchase put to competitive bid, and will generate          a corporate tax deduction. Many investors are also          pension fund beneficiaries, so are already paying the          cost anyway.)</p>
	          </blockquote>
		      <p>Proxy advisory firms such as Proxy Monitor (<a href="http://www.proxymonitor.com">http://www.proxymonitor.com</a>),      Institutional Shareholder Services (<a href="http://iss.cda.com">http://iss.cda.com</a>), and      Investor Responsibility Research Center (<a href="http://www.irrc.org">http://www.irrc.org</a>) are      frequently cited in the financial press. Examples are      &quot;Venator Holders Are Urged To Support Dissident      Slate&quot; (<em>Wall Street Journal</em> 07/06/1999) and      &quot;ISS's Influence Grows In Proxy, Option Matters&quot; (<em>Wall      Street Journal</em> 11/10/1997).</p>
		      <p>Articles discussing the company-pay system for proxy      advice are on the Corporate Monitoring website (<a href="http://www.corpmon.com/publications.htm">http://www.corpmon.com/publications.htm</a>).      These include &quot;Collective Action for Dispersed      Shareowners&quot; (<em>Corporate Governance International</em>,      September 1999) and &quot;The Internet Will Drive Corporate      Monitoring&quot; (<em>Gouvernance</em>, Winter 2000). Further      developments in corporate governance that may follow from      this proposal are presented in &quot;The Corporate Monitoring      Firm&quot; (<em>Corporate Governance: An International Review</em>,      January 1999) and &quot;Corporate Monitoring: New Shareholder      Power Tool&quot; (<em>Financial Analysts Journal</em>,      September/October 1998).</p>
