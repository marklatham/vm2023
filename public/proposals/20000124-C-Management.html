		      <p><strong>Re: Stockholder Proposal to Citigroup Inc.      (&quot;Citigroup&quot;) of Mark Latham, Ph.D.</strong></p>
		      <p><strong>Dear Sir or Madam:</strong></p>
		      <p><strong>This is in response to the letter dated January 10,      2000 from Mark Latham, Ph.D., opposing the petition for      no-action submitted by Citigroup dated December 22, 1999.</strong></p>
		      <p><strong>Citigroup submits that the Proponent&rsquo;s assertions      lack merit and are unresponsive to the bases for omission set      forth by Citigroup in its petition. Moreover, the      Proponent&rsquo;s submission of a &quot;Revised Proposal&quot;      fails to address the bases for omission set forth in the      petition. For example, the Proponent&rsquo;s substitution of      precatory language to revise his Proposal is irrelevant to      the bases for omission submitted by Citigroup. Similarly, the      Proponent&rsquo;s assertions that retention of a proxy advisor      for stockholders &quot;would not prevent the Company from      hiring consultants, so it does not interfere with the      Company&rsquo;s ordinary business operations&quot; and      &quot;would not restrict the Company from hiring any other      external consultants&quot; are irrelevant to Citigroup&rsquo;s      position. Citigroup made no such contentions.</strong></p>
		      <p>&nbsp;</p>
		      <p><strong>I. </strong><strong><u>Rule 14a-8(i)(7</u></strong><strong>)</strong></p>
		      <p><strong>Citigroup&rsquo;s position is that retention of a proxy      advisor selected by stockholders through annual meeting proxy      materials and ultimately in the course of the annual meeting,      relates to the Company&rsquo;s ordinary business operations in      a number of ways, and therefore, may be excluded under Rule      14a-8(i)(7). First, retention of a consultant to be paid by      the Company relates to ordinary business operations. Second,      supplementary disclosure in the Company&rsquo;s proxy      materials concerning retention of a consultant relates to      ordinary business operations.</strong></p>
		      <p><strong>The Proponent contends that &quot;choosing a proxy      advisory firm will be an easier decision for shareowners than      other matters they are asked to vote on, including      compensation plans, directors and most proposals.&quot; The      Proponent then goes on to compare selection of a proxy      advisory firm with selection of a personal computer to      purchase. Proxy statement disclosure. which is complete and      accurate gives fairly extensive information regarding the      matters to be voted upon. With all due respect to the      Proponent, the Proxy Statement is not the appropriate forum      for a </strong><strong><em>Consumer Reports </em></strong><strong>guide to proxy      advisory firms, without which stockholders may not have      sufficient material to make an informed decision.</strong></p>
		      <p>&nbsp;</p>
		      <p><strong>II. </strong><strong><u>Rule 14a-8(i)(4</u></strong><strong>)</strong></p>
		      <p><strong>Significantly, the &quot;Revised Proposal&quot; is not      revised in any meaningful way with respect to the      proponent&rsquo;s personal interest in its inclusion in the      Citigroup Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the      Proponent&rsquo;s claim that the Proposal is solely designed      to benefit Citigroup stockholders, a proposal revised in a      manner to exclude fully the Proponent&rsquo;s self interest      would have omitted the Proponent&rsquo;s Web site.</strong></p>
		      <p><strong>The Proponent contends that any potential benefit to be      derived by him from the Proposal would be incidental. The      Proponent also contends that the revised proposal is neutral      on its face, as well as in its design and substance. The      Proponent further contends that there is no paid advertising      on his Web site. Citigroup disputes each of these claims.</strong></p>
		      <p><strong>As discussed more fully in Citigroup&rsquo;s petition,      the Citigroup Proxy Statement should not serve as a forum for      free advertising of the Proponent&rsquo;s Web site to the many      thousands of Citigroup investors. While there may be no paid      advertising on the proponent&rsquo;s Web site currently, that      could change if this Proposal is included in the Citigroup      Proxy Statement because the opportunity for paid advertising      depends, generally, on the number of &quot;hits&quot; or      visits to a Web site. Consequently, if thousands of investors      are made aware of the Web site, the number of visits would      likely increase, thereby attracting potential paid      advertisers.</strong></p>
		      <p><strong>Significantly, in discussing his commercial interests      as set forth on his Web site, the Proponent claims that if      his proposal is successful in helping shareowners, his      professional reputation would be enhanced and he expects      opportunities for consulting or full-time employment. This      candid disclosure conflicts with the Proponent&rsquo;s      purportedly selfless motives. This telling disclosure further      bolsters Citigroup&rsquo;s contention that the benefit to be      gained by the Proponent in advertising his Web site in      Citigroup&rsquo;s Proxy Statement is disproportionate to the      possible benefit other shareholders may derive.</strong></p>
		      <p>&nbsp;</p>
		      <p><strong>III. </strong><strong><u>Rule 14a-8(i)(3</u></strong><strong>)</strong></p>
		      <p><strong>Neither the Proponent&rsquo;s letter nor the      &quot;Revised Proposal&quot; resolves the fundamental      ambiguities and misleading nature of the Proposal, as set      forth more fully in Citigroup&rsquo;s petition. For example,      the Proponent fails to explain what criteria stockholders      would employ to evaluate the various proxy advisory firms      that pay an entry fee and have their names placed on the      ballot. How will stockholders distinguish one firm from      another? By summarily declaring, &quot;Everyone reading      business newspapers or magazines learns about the reputations      of companies and people in many fields,&quot; the Proponent      glosses over the key element that would make the stockholder      vote meaningful and informative.</strong></p>
		      <p><strong>Moreover, the discussion on personal computers and      potential media coverage for proxy advisory firms is      similarly flawed. It is entirely unclear what media coverage      the Proponent anticipates prior to the Company&rsquo;s 2001      Annual Meeting and relying on such speculative coverage as a      source of information for stockholders is illogical. Whereas      personal computers have been on the market for many years and      have been covered extensively by the media, proxy advisory      firms are surely not likely to generate such coverage before      the 2001 Annual Meeting. These are fatal gaps in the logic      underlying the Proposal that highlight its misleading nature      and preclude stockholders from understanding the subject      matter on which they being asked to vote.</strong></p>
