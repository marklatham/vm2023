	        <blockquote>
              <p align="center"><strong>PROPOSAL 3 - SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL</strong></p>
	          <p>Mr. James McRitchie and Ms. Myra Young, having an office      at 2461 Second Avenue, Sacramento, CA 95818, owner of at      least $2,000 in market value of Whole Foods Market, Inc.      shares, have proposed the adoption of the following      resolution and have furnished the following statement in      support of their proposal:</p>
	          <p align="center"><strong>HIRE PROXY ADVISORY FIRM CHOSEN BY      SHAREHOLDER VOTE</strong></p>
	          <p>WHEREAS many shareowners lack the time and expertise to      make the best voting decisions, yet prefer not to always      follow management's recommendations because of management's      possible conflicts of interest;</p>
	          <p>WHEREAS proxy advisory firms have established reputations      for giving sound independent advice to many institutional      investors on how to vote their shares;</p>
	          <p>WHEREAS shareowners have a common interest in obtaining      sound independent advice, but often insufficient private      interest to justify paying for it individually (the      &quot;free-rider&quot; problem);</p>
	          <p>THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Whole Foods Market      shareowners request the Board of Directors to hire a proxy      advisory firm for one year, to be chosen by shareowner vote.      Shareowners request the Board to take all necessary steps to      enact this resolution in time to hold the vote at next year's      shareowner meeting, with the following features:</p>
	          <p>To insulate the selection of the proxy advisory firm from      influence by Company management, any proxy advisory firm      could put itself on the ballot by paying an entry fee (for      example, $1000) and declaring the price for its advisory      service for the coming year. The price could be no more than      $5000. (The entry fee would be refunded to each candidate      receiving over 5% of votes cast.) The winning candidate would      be paid its declared price by the Company, and expected to      make voting recommendations freely available to all Company      shareowners for the subsequent year. Fulfillment of that      expectation would not be policed by Company management, but      rather by loss of reputation and future business if      performance is disappointing.</p>
	          <p>The decision of whether to hire proxy advisory firms in      later years would be left open, and could be decided by      future shareowner votes.</p>
	          <p><strong>Supporting Statement:</strong></p>
	          <p>This proposal will enhance management accountability to      shareowners by making professionally researched advice      available to all. It will effectively enfranchise individual      investors for the first time, ensuring that a majority of      shares can be voted independently of management's      recommendations. The company- pay system will encourage      greater competition among proxy advisory firms to serve      shareowner interests, and the increased impact of their      advice can be expected to improve the return on Whole Foods      Market stock.</p>
	          <p>Proxy advisory firms such as Proxy Monitor (<a href="http://www.proxymonitor.com">http://www.proxymonitor.com</a>),      Institutional Shareholder Services (<a href="http://iss.cda.com">http://iss.cda.com</a>), and      Investor Responsibility Research Center (<a href="http://www.irrc.org">http://www.irrc.org</a>) are      frequently cited in the financial press. For example in      &quot;Venator Holders Are Urged To Support Dissident      Slate&quot; (Wall Street Journal 07/06/1999), &quot;Investor      Activists Await New Legal Test On Binding Votes&quot; (Dow      Jones Newswire 09/24/1999), and &quot;ISS's Influence Grows      In Proxy, Option Matters&quot; (Wall Street Journal      11/10/1997).</p>
	          <p>Articles discussing the company-pay system for proxy      advice are on the Corporate Monitoring website (<a href="http://www.corpmon.com/publications.htm">http://www.corpmon.com/publications.htm</a>).      These include &quot;Collective Action for Dispersed      Shareowners&quot; (Corporate Governance International,      September 1999) and &quot;The Internet Will Drive Corporate      Monitoring&quot;. Further developments in corporate      governance that may follow from this company-pay system are      presented in &quot;The Corporate Monitoring Firm&quot;      (Corporate Governance: An International Review, January 1999)      and &quot;Corporate Monitoring: New Shareholder Power      Tool&quot; (Financial Analysts Journal, September/October      1998).</p>
