		    <p><em>Revision submitted to Calpine on March 26, 2004 by shareowner Mark Latham:</em></p>
		    <hr />
		    <h3><strong>VOTING LEVERAGE  PROPOSAL </strong></h3>
		    <blockquote>
              <p>WHEREAS shareowners should have the right to vote any way they want (except     for buying and selling votes); </p>
		      <p>WHEREAS many individual shareowners lack the time and expertise to make the     best voting decisions themselves, yet prefer not to always follow directors&rsquo;     recommendations, because of possible conflicts of interest; </p>
		      <p>WHEREAS several institutional investors now publish their voting decisions     more than one week before each company&rsquo;s voting deadline; </p>
		      <p>THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Calpine Corporation shareowners request the     Board of Directors to study and report on the feasibility of enabling     shareowners to conveniently imitate an institutional investor&rsquo;s voting     decisions, on all matters put to shareowner vote except director elections.     (Director elections are excluded here to satisfy SEC rule 14a-8(i)(8).). So     for example, besides being offered a convenient choice of voting the entire     proxy as the Board recommends, perhaps shareowners could be offered a     similarly convenient choice of voting the entire proxy (except director     elections) the same way Calvert Group votes its shares. </p>
		      <p><u>Supporting Statement: </u></p>
		      <p>Institutional investors that publish their voting decisions on the     worldwide web include: </p>
		      <p>&nbsp;- CalPERS (California Public Employees' Retirement System) at <a href="http://www.calpers-governance.org/alert/proxy"> www.calpers-governance.org/alert/proxy</a></p>
		      <p>&nbsp;- Calvert Group at <a href="http://www.calvert.com/planning_2627.html"> www.calvert.com/planning_2627.html</a></p>
		      <p>&nbsp;- Domini Social Investments at <a href="http://www.domini.com/shareholder-advocacy/Proxy-Voting"> www.domini.com/shareholder-advocacy/Proxy-Voting</a></p>
		      <p>&nbsp;- MMA Praxis Mutual Funds at <a href="http://www.mmapraxis.com/corporate/proxy_voting_set.html"> www.mmapraxis.com/corporate/proxy_voting_set.html</a></p>
		      <p>&nbsp;- Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan at <a href="http://www.otpp.com/web/proxyvot.nsf/proxyvotes?openform"> www.otpp.com/web/proxyvot.nsf/proxyvotes?openform</a></p>
		      <p>&nbsp;- Pax World Fund at <a href="http://www.paxfund.com/proxyvote4.htm"> www.paxfund.com/proxyvote4.htm</a></p>
		      <p>In particular, Calvert Group and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan published     voting decisions for Calpine Corporation&rsquo;s proxy in recent years. </p>
		      <p>In the proponent&rsquo;s opinion: <br />
		        - One of the main reasons for having shareowner voting at all is that there     would be conflicts of interest inherent in leaving all decisions to the Board. <br />
		        - Simply following the Board&rsquo;s voting recommendations does little to     counterbalance such conflicts. <br />
		        - Introducing competing sources of convenient guidance for individual     shareowners could help make voting more independent of the Board. </p>
		      <p>Example of shareowners&rsquo; lack of time and expertise: <a href="http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=19682916"> http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=19682916</a> : &ldquo;I tried to read the     proxy statement, but I still don't understand whether the change is     shareholder friendly or not.&rdquo; </p>
		      <p>Evidence of shareowners&rsquo; mistrust of boards: Harris Poll, September 2003,     at <a href="http://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s71903/gmcentee092403.pdf"> www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s71903/gmcentee092403.pdf</a> : &ldquo;Support for     corporate management nominees is also mixed with majorities of shareholders     having withheld support from a management nominee.&rdquo;</p>
		      <p>The conflicts of interest among managers, directors and shareowners are     described in Robert Monks&rsquo; and Nell Minow&rsquo;s 1996 book Watching the Watchers,     along with shareowners&rsquo; &ldquo;free rider&rdquo; and &ldquo;rational ignorance&rdquo; problems. </p>
		      <p>The potential benefits of this proposal are discussed in the article &ldquo;Vote     Your Stock&rdquo; on the web at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040402075744/www.corpmon.com/publications.htm"> www.corpmon.com/publications.htm</a> .</p>
