		    <p><em>Shareowner proposal submitted to SONICblue on November 24, 2000:</em></p>
		    <hr />
		    <h3><strong>AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE BY SHAREOWNER  VOTE</strong></h3>
		    <blockquote>
              <p>WHEREAS auditor independence of Company management helps      guarantee the integrity of financial statements;</p>
		      <p>WHEREAS auditor selection by Company management may      compromise auditor independence of Company management;</p>
		      <p>THEREFORE SONICblue shareowners request the Board of      Directors to have the auditor selected annually by shareowner      vote. To insulate auditor selection from influence by Company      management, any qualified auditing firm could put itself on      the ballot. Shareowners request the Board to take all      necessary steps to enact this resolution in time to hold the      first such vote at the year-2002 shareowner meeting.</p>
		      <p><u>Supporting Statement:</u></p>
		      <p><em>Wall Street Journal</em>, October 25, 2000: &quot;SEC      Chairman Arthur Levitt believes that new standards are needed      to maintain investor confidence in the reliability and      accuracy of audited financial statements of public companies.      Independence, he has said, could be compromised if audit      partners are concerned about losing lucrative consulting      business. Without safeguards, audit partners might lose      objectivity when reviewing work done by consulting      affiliates, the SEC has argued.&quot;</p>
		      <p><em>The Economist</em>, October 28, 2000: &quot;There is      plenty of evidence that financial statements often fail to      come up to scratch. The number of companies restating their      accounts&mdash;never in ways that make them appear      healthier&mdash;has been rising so fast as to have become      almost commonplace. Well-known firms whose audited profits      shrunk in a restatement include Waste Management, Sunbeam and      CUC International, during its merger with Cendant. Investors      have lost billions of dollars, and much of their faith in      auditors.&quot;</p>
		      <p>In the current system, management chooses the auditor, and      shareowners merely rubber-stamp that choice. Under this      proposal however, shareowners would choose (by vote) among      several auditing firms competing for the position. This would      encourage auditors to build their reputations in the eyes of      investors rather than in the eyes of management, creating new      pressure for higher standards. Investors could decide how      important auditor independence is to them, and how it should      be assessed.</p>
		      <p>The average investor may seem ill-equipped to make such      assessments on her own. But she would not make them on her      own. She would benefit from consensus-building discussion by      the entire investment community, including proxy advisory      firms. It is much easier to assess reputations of auditors      than of board members, because there are only a handful of      auditing firms, versus hundreds of board candidates for a      diversified portfolio of stocks over the years.</p>
		      <p>As with other voting items in the proxy, management would      presumably make a recommendation on which auditor to choose.      Even if the management-recommended auditor is never voted      out, a rising percentage of opposition votes would provide a      healthy early warning to the auditor, that its reputation is      slipping and corrective action is required.</p>
		      <p>This is not to imply that there are accounting biases at      SONICblue in particular, but no one knows when and where      problems may occur. This proposal would create a competitive      market for auditor reputation. Investors would be given the      power and flexibility to determine standards of auditing      services that best meet their needs.</p>
