		    <h3><strong>GILLETTE BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION ON  THE</strong><strong> PROXY ADVISOR PROPOSAL </strong><strong></strong><strong>IN 2001  PROXY</strong> STATEMENT </h3>

                <hr />
                <p><strong>THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A      VOTE </strong><em><strong>AGAINST</strong></em><strong> THIS      PROPOSAL FOR THE REASONS SET FORTH BELOW.</strong></p>
		        <p>The Board of Directors is committed to      providing Gillette's stockholders with useful voting      recommendations and information on which to make voting      decisions. The Board bases its recommendations on its      knowledge of Gillette, its strategic plans for the business      and input from management and outside advisers. We do not      believe adding<strong><a href="#1">[1]</a></strong> the advice of unsupervised<a href="#2"><strong>[2]</strong></a> firms      at our expense would be in the interests of our stockholders.</p>
		        <p>This proposal calls for us to hire a proxy      advisory firm without screening, input or review by our Board      or management of the quality of the firm or its work product.<a href="#3"><strong>[3]</strong></a> Even our independent auditors are selected and      supervised by the Board.<a href="#4"><strong>[4]</strong></a> Further, the proposal calls for the firm to be paid      without regard to the reasonableness of this compensation for      the work performed.<a href="#5"><strong>[5]</strong></a> While the proposal purports to cap the fees paid to      the elected proxy advisory firms, we believe the actual costs      of the proposal will be greater.<a href="#6"><strong>[6]</strong></a> We do      not believe it is a good idea for us to abdicate our      responsibilities<a href="#7"><strong>[7]</strong></a> to evaluate the engagement, services and      compensation of outside advisers, and do not believe we      should provide an open forum in our proxy materials<a href="#8"><strong>[8]</strong></a> for an unknown and unsupervised firm. In addition,      our counsel has advised us that implementation of this      proposal would violate Delaware law.<a href="#9"><strong>[9]</strong></a></p>
		        <p>We do not believe that adoption of the      proposal is in the best interests of Gillette or its      stockholders.<a href="#10"><strong>[10]</strong></a></p>
		        <p><strong>THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A      VOTE </strong><em><strong>AGAINST</strong></em><strong> THIS      PROPOSAL, WHICH IS DESIGNATED AS PROPOSAL NO. 6 ON THE      ENCLOSED PROXY.</strong></p>
		        <hr />
              </blockquote>
		      <p><strong>PROPONENT'S RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE:</strong></p>
		      <p><a name="1" id="1"><strong>1</strong></a><strong>.</strong> As the  Board mentions here, the independent advisor's recommendation  would <em><strong>add to</strong></em>, rather than replace, the  Board's recommendation on which way to vote. So Gillette  shareowners could benefit from both sources of advice.</p>
		      <p><a name="2" id="2"><strong>2</strong></a><strong>. &amp; </strong><a name="3" id="3"><strong>3</strong></a><strong>.</strong> We agree with  the Board's implication that the quality of the advisory firm is  crucial, but not with the implication that supervision by the  Board is necessary to assure that quality. Gillette shareowners  would vote to choose the advisory firm based on its reputation in  their eyes. Advisors would compete to build reputations for  giving advice that benefits shareowners. Those reputations would  be assessed and discussed by the financial community in much the  same way that personal computer makers' reputations are  determined in the technology community, so that even a non-expert  could make an informed choice by reading, for example, the <em>Wall  Street Journal</em>.</p>
		      <p><a name="4" id="4"><strong>4</strong></a><strong>.</strong> We agree  with the Board that the selection of independent auditors is a  good parallel to this proposal for selecting a voting advisor. It  is difficult to assure auditor independence when the Board  chooses the auditor. See our <a href="http://www.corpmon.com/AudInd-SBLU.htm">Auditor  Independence Proposal</a>, especially this quote from <em>The  Economist</em>, October 28, 2000: </p>
		      <blockquote>
                <p>&quot;There is plenty of evidence that financial      statements often fail to come up to scratch. The number of      companies restating their accounts&mdash;never in ways that      make them appear healthier&mdash;has been rising so fast as to      have become almost commonplace. Well-known firms whose      audited profits shrunk in a restatement include Waste      Management, Sunbeam and CUC International, during its merger      with Cendant. Investors have lost billions of dollars, and      much of their faith in auditors.&quot;</p>
	          </blockquote>
		      <p>It is likewise important for voting advice to be independent  of the Board. The reason why we have shareowner voting at all is  that there would be conflicts of interest inherent in leaving all  decisions to the Board.</p>
		      <p><a name="5" id="5"><strong>5</strong></a><strong>.</strong> In fact, the proposal calls for the firm to be paid while taking  into account the reasonableness of this compensation. As stated  in the proposal, each candidate advisory firm would declare the  price for its services. So when Gillette shareowners then vote to  choose the advisor, they would take the price into account.</p>
		      <p><a name="6" id="6"><strong>6</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Regarding the cost of the proposal,  note that two leading proxy advisory firms already analyze and  provide proxy voting advice on Gillette every year, for  institutional shareowners who subscribe to their services. They  are Proxy Monitor (<a href="http://www.proxymonitor.com">http://www.proxymonitor.com</a>)  and Institutional Shareholder Services (<a href="http://iss.cda.com">http://iss.cda.com</a>). They would  incur little or no additional cost to provide their advice to  Gillette for inclusion in the proxy, so that all shareowners  could benefit from it and vote more intelligently. The proposal  would also encourage more direct competition on price and  quality.</p>
		      <p><a name="7" id="7"><strong>7</strong></a><strong>.</strong> This  would be an <em>assignment</em> of responsibilities to the  shareowners, not an abdication. As described in points 2 &amp; 3  above, shareowners would be quite capable of choosing advisors  based on reputation.</p>
		      <p><a name="8" id="8"><strong>8</strong></a><strong>.</strong> We agree  that Gillette's proxy should not be an open forum. That is why  the proposal calls for an entry fee, which can be adjusted to  deter all but the serious candidates.</p>
		      <p><a name="9" id="9"><strong>9</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The SEC  examined the Gillette counsel's argument that  implementation of this proposal would violate Delaware law, and  that the proposal should therefore be excluded from Gillette's  proxy. The reason why the proposal is now in Gillette's proxy is  that the SEC did not concur with that argument. This is  another illustration of the difficulty of assuring independence  when the Board chooses an advisor.</p>
		      <p><a name="10" id="10"><strong>10</strong></a><strong>.</strong> We  believe that adoption of this proposal is in the best interests  of all of us Gillette shareowners.</p>
