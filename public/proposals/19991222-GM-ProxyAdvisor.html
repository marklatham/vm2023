		    <p><em>Shareowner proposal submitted to General Motors on December 22, 1999:</em></p>
		    <hr />
		    <h3 align="center"><strong>INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS OF THE GM PROXY</strong></h3>
		    <blockquote>
		      <p>This shareholder      resolution is submitted by Ray T. Chevedden and Veronica G.      Chevedden, owners of 2000 shares of General Motors stock, for      vote at the GM shareholder meeting.</p>
		      <p>RESOLVED:</p>
		      <p><strong>INDEPENDENT      ANALYSIS OF THE GM PROXY </strong></p>
		      <p>An independent      analysis be published in the proxy statement regarding each      item for vote at the shareholder meeting (Recommendation). </p>
		      <p>SUPPORTING      STATEMENT:</p>
		      <p>This includes the      major items for vote at annual shareholder meetings: </p>
		      <p>&bull; Directors </p>
		      <p>&bull; Auditors </p>
		      <p>&bull; Management      proposals </p>
		      <p>&bull; Shareholder      proposals </p>
		      <p>The analysis shall      be an independent critique focused on the issues for      improvement regarding company directors, auditors and      management proposals. Thus shareholder decisions on      directors, auditors and management proposals will have the      benefit of contrasting view-points for an informed decision.      Currently only shareholder resolutions have the of benefit of      contrasting view-points to make informed decisions. </p>
		      <p>Since only the      shareholder proposals now have contrasting view-points, the      independent critique on shareholder proposals may include      both sides of the issues.</p>
		      <p>Plain English Rule:      This analysis shall be consistent with the updated Staff      Legal Bulletin No. 7, SEC No-Action Letters Ind. &amp;      Summaries (September 4, 1998) with information on the plain      English rule.</p>
		      <p>A proxy statement      with contrasting view-points is particularly important since      most proxy statements usually arrive within a 2-month period      in the early spring. Shareholders thus have a limited time to      make an informed decision and would benefit from contrasting      view-points presented in the same document. The company shall      not over-rule the text and formatting of independent analysis      report. It shall be up to 500 words per item.</p>
		      <p>Major independent      proxy advisory firms include:</p>
		      <p>Institutional      Shareholder Services (http://iss.cda.com)</p>
		      <p>Investor      Responsibility Research Center (http://www.irrc.org) </p>
		      <p>Proxy Monitor      (http://www.proxymonitor.com)</p>
		      <p>The same proxy      advisory firm shall not prepare this analysis more than one      time in any 3-year period. </p>
		      <p>For example under      this proposal GM shareholders would have been entitled to      know before they cast their vote, that GM director oversight      in 1999 could be compromised by:</p>
		      <p>&bull; Five      interlocking cross-directors.</p>
		      <p>&bull; One director      overextended with 11 board seats at other companies.</p>
		      <p>&bull; Two      directors entrenched with 17 years and 27 years on the board.</p>
		      <p>&bull; Two      directors linked to companies that did considerable business      with GM.</p>
		      <p>&bull; Four      directors owned 1000 shares or less.</p>
		      <p>To improve      shareholder opportunity to make informed decisions, vote yes      for:</p>
		      <p align="center"><strong>INDEPENDENT      ANALYSIS OF THE GM PROXY </strong></p>
		      <p align="center"><strong>YES      on 6*</strong></p>
		      <p>* The Company is      respectfully requested to insert the correct item numbers for      the 2000 proxy statement.</p>
