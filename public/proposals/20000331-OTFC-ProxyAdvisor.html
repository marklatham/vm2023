		    <p><em>Shareowner proposal submitted to Oregon Trail Financial on March 31, 2000:</em></p>
		    <hr />
		    <h3><strong>HIRE PROXY ADVISORY FIRM CHOSEN BY  SHAREOWNER VOTE</strong></h3>
		    <blockquote>
              <p>WHEREAS many shareowners lack the time and      expertise to make the best voting decisions, yet prefer not      to always follow management&rsquo;s recommendations, because      of management&rsquo;s possible conflicts of interest;</p>
		      <p>WHEREAS proxy advisory firms have      established reputations for giving sound independent advice      to investors on voting their shares;</p>
		      <p>WHEREAS shareowners have a common interest      in obtaining sound independent advice, but often insufficient      private interest t<a href="http://www.corpmon.com/ProxyAdvisorFAQ.htm"></a>o justify paying for it individually (the      &quot;free-rider&quot; problem);</p>
		      <p>THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Oregon Trail      Financial Corp. shareowners request the Board of Directors to      hire a proxy advisory firm for one year, to be chosen by      shareowner vote. Shareowners request the Board to take all      necessary steps to enact this resolution in time to hold the      vote at the year-2001 shareowner meeting, with the following      features:</p>
		      <blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>- To insulate advisor selection              from influence by Company management, any proxy              advisory firm could put itself on the ballot by              paying an entry fee, declaring the price (no more              than $3000) for advisory services for the coming              year, and providing the address of a website              describing their proposed services and              qualifications.</p>
                  <p>- The winning candidate would be              paid its declared price by the Company, and make              advice freely available to all Company shareowners              for the subsequent year, on all matters put to              shareowner vote except director elections. This              advice could relate to such matters as mergers, stock              option plans, and shareowner proposals. (Advice on              director elections is excluded to satisfy SEC rule              14a-8(i)(8).)</p>
                  <p>- Performance of the advisory firm              would not be policed by Company management, but              rather by gain or loss of the advisor&rsquo;s              reputation and future business.</p>
                  <p>- Brief summary advice could be              included in the Company proxy, with references to a              website and/or a toll-free phone number for more              detail.</p>
                  <p>- The decision of whether to hire              proxy advisory firms in later years would be left              open, and could be decided by future shareowner              votes.</p>
                </blockquote>
	          </blockquote>
		      <p><u>Supporting Statement:</u></p>
		      <p>This proposal can be expected to improve      the Company&rsquo;s stock return by:</p>
		      <blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>- improving management              accountability to shareowners by making independent              professionally researched advice available to all;</p>
                  <p>- increasing support for              value-enhancing mergers and proposals;</p>
                  <p>- encouraging greater competition              among advisory firms to serve shareowner interests.</p>
                </blockquote>
	          </blockquote>
		      <p>Proxy advisory firms such as Proxy Monitor      (<a href="http://www.proxymonitor.com">http://www.proxymonitor.com</a>) and Institutional Shareholder Services (<a href="http://iss.cda.com">http://iss.cda.com</a>) are frequently cited in the financial press.      Examples are &quot;Venator Holders Are Urged To Support      Dissident Slate&quot; (<em>Wall Street Journal</em> 07/06/1999)      and &quot;ISS's Influence Grows In Proxy, Option      Matters&quot; (<em>Wall Street Journal</em> 11/10/1997).</p>
		      <p>Articles discussing the company-pay system      for proxy advice are on the Corporate Monitoring website (<a href="http://www.corpmon.com/publications.htm">http://www.corpmon.com/publications.htm</a>). These include &quot;Collective Action for      Dispersed Shareowners&quot; (<em>Corporate Governance      International</em>, September 1999) and &quot;The Internet      Will Drive Corporate Monitoring&quot;. Further developments      in corporate governance that may follow from this proposal      are presented in &quot;The Corporate Monitoring Firm&quot; (<em>Corporate      Governance: An International Review</em>, January 1999) and      &quot;Corporate Monitoring: New Shareholder Power Tool&quot;      (<em>Financial Analysts Journal</em>, September/October 1998).</p>
