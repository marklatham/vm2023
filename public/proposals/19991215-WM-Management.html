		      <p><strong>Re: Shareholder Proposal of Jerome Gabig </strong></p>
		      <p>Dear Sir or Madam:</p>
		      <p>Washington Mutual, Inc., a Washington corporation,          (the &quot;Company&quot;) has received a shareholder          proposal and supporting statement (the          &quot;Proposal&quot;), attached hereto as <u>Exhibit A</u>,          from Jerome Gabig (the &quot;Proponent&quot; or &quot;Mr.          Gabig&quot;). The Proposal asks the shareholders to          request the Company to hire for one year a proxy advisory          firm to be chosen by the shareholders. To accomplish          that, the Proposal requires the Company to allow any          proxy advisory firm to &quot;put itself on the          ballot&quot; for the 2001 annual shareholders&rsquo;          meeting &quot;by paying an entry fee and declaring the          price (no more than $5,000) for its advisory          services.&quot; The Company&rsquo;s shareholders would          select a proxy advisory firm at the 2001 annual          shareholders&rsquo; meeting. The Proposal further requires          the Company to pay the declared price to the selected          proxy advisory firm and specifies that the Company          management cannot &quot;police&quot; the firm&rsquo;sperformance.          The firm selected by the shareholders is expected to make          voting recommendations freely available to all          shareholders of the Company. The Proposal specifies that          shareholders will decide by future votes whether to hire          proxy advisory firms in later years.</p>
		      <p>The Company believes that it may properly exclude the          Proposal from its proxy materials being prepared for the          2000 annual meeting of shareholders. Pursuant to Rule          14a-8(j), promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act          of 1934, as amended, the Company encloses six copies of          this letter and the Proposal. This letter constitutes an          explanation of why the Company believes that it may          exclude the Proposal from its proxy materials. To the          extent that the reasons for the exclusion are based on          matters of the law of the State of Washington, these          reasons are the opinions of the undersigned as an          attorney licensed and admitted to practice law in the          State of Washington.</p>
		      <p>By this letter, the Company requests that the Division          of Corporation Finance (the &quot;Division&quot;), and          its staff (the &quot;Staff&quot;), of the Securities and          Exchange Commission (the &quot;Commission&quot;) not          recommend any enforcement action if the Company excludes          the Proposal from its proxy materials.</p>
		      <p>The Company believes that it may exclude the Proposal          under two independently sufficient grounds: Rule          14a-8(i)(7) and Rule 14a-8(i)(1).</p>
		      <p><strong>The Company may exclude the Proposal under Rule          14a-8(i)(7) because it deals with a matter relating to          the Company&rsquo;s ordinary business operations.</strong></p>
		      <p>Rule 14a-8(i)(7) allows a company to exclude a          proposal if it &quot;deals with a matter relating to the          company&rsquo;s ordinary business operations.&quot; The          Company believes that the Proposal deals with the          Company&rsquo;s ordinary business operations because, if          adopted, it would require the Company to hire external          consultants and, furthermore, it would entirely eliminate          the Company from the process of selecting such          consultants. Therefore, the Company may properly exclude          the Proposal under Rule 14a-8(i)(7).</p>
		      <p>The Division has long taken the position that the          registrant&rsquo;s hiring, retention, and compensation          policies for employees and external consultants relate to          the registrant&rsquo;s ordinary business operations, even          though the matters they work on may be </p>
		      <p>extraordinary. United Technologies (February 19, 1993)          (employment and personnel decisions &quot;have been          deemed to be excludable&quot; as ordinary business          operations); Texaco, Inc. (January 21, 1983) (the          decision to hire outside consultants to study certain          marketing practices relates to the registrant&rsquo;s          ordinary business operations); Bob Evans Farms, Inc.          (June 23, 1997) (a proposal mandating the board of          directors consider and select a consulting firm to advise          the board and management on the registrant&rsquo;s poor          financial performance relates to the registrant&rsquo;s          ordinary business operations); Potomac Electric Power          Company (March 3, 1992) (a proposal requiring hiring of          an independent investigatory body that would report to          the shareholders the management&rsquo;s conduct that          resulted in impairment of shareholders equity relates to          the registrant&rsquo;s ordinary business operations); Long          Island Lighting Co. (January 22, 1986) (a proposal          instituting guidelines for selecting independent auditors          relates to the registrant&rsquo;s ordinary business          operations).</p>
		      <p>Similarly to the authorities cited above, the instant          Proposal seeks to establish a policy for employing          independent consultants, a matter relating to the          Company&rsquo;s ordinary business operations. The Proposal          requires the Company to hire a proxy advisory firm, an          external consultant, which is clearly contrary to the          Division&rsquo;s long established position that the          decision whether to hire an external consultant relates          to the registrant&rsquo;s ordinary business operations.          Further, the Division consistently agrees that the          proposals permitting shareholders to establish employment          policies for external consultants, including the hiring          and firing guidelines, are excludable. Long Island          Lighting Co. (January 22, 1986); United Banks of          Colorado, Inc. (March 13, 1973) (a proposal for          shareholders&rsquo; ratification of the legal counsel          selected by the registrant is excludable as a matter          relating to the ordinary business operations); Atlantic          Energy (February 17, 1989) (guidelines for selecting          independent contractors and employees relate to the          registrant&rsquo;s ordinary business operations). The          instant Proposal would grant the shareholder the power to          select a proxy advisory firm, an external consultant.          Further, it would take away the Company&rsquo;s power to          fire, or withhold the payment from, the proxy advisory          firm if its performance is unsatisfactory. According to          the Proposal, the Company would not have the power to          control even such ordinary matters as the timing and the          manner of delivery of information from the proxy advisory          firm to the shareholders. The Company believes that all          these functions relate to its ordinary business          operations, and, therefore, the Proposal is excludable          under Rule 14a-8(i)(7).</p>
		      <p>Even more so than the decision whether to hire an          external consultant, the decision as to which particular          consultant should be hired relates to the          registrant&rsquo;s ordinary business operations. Avondale          Financial Corporation (August 30, 1995) (a decision          &quot;who the company may hire&quot; relates to the          company&rsquo;s ordinary business operation). The instant          Proposal attempts to do much more than any of the          shareholder proposals discussed in the foregoing          no-action letters. Rather than simply requiring the          Company to hire an external consultant or imposing upon          the Company impermissible guidelines and criteria for          selecting such a consultant, the Proposal attempts to          remove the selection process completely from the purview          of the Company. This violates the underlying policy of          Rule 14a-8(i)(7).</p>
		      <p>The policy behind Rule 14a-8(i)(7) is &quot;to confine          the resolution of ordinary business problems to          management and the board of directors, since it is          impracticable for shareholders to decide how to solve          such problems at an annual shareholders meeting.&quot;          Release No. 34-40018 (May 21, 1998) (the &quot;1998          Release&quot;). Also, Rule 14a-8(i)(7) was designed to          &quot;deal with ordinary business matters of a complex          nature that shareholders, as a group, would not be          qualified to make an informed judgment on, due to their          lack of business expertise and their lack of intimate          knowledge of the issuer&rsquo;s business.&quot; Release          No. 34-12999 (November 22, 1976). The selection of a          proxy advisory firm is exactly such an &quot;ordinary          matter of a complex nature.&quot; The Proposal, if          adopted, would allow a proxy advisory firm to nominate          itself for shareholders&rsquo; vote by disclosing only its          fee. For example, nothing prevents a person or entity,          which had absolutely no experience in the proxy advisory          business, to nominate itself for the shareholders&rsquo;          vote. Shareholders who lack business expertise would          inevitably be tempted to vote for the firm quoting the          lowest fee for its services. The selection of          consultants, however, is a much more complicated process          than a simple comparison of fees. In addition to          consultants&rsquo; fees, companies may consider the          prospective consultants&rsquo; expertise, prior          experience, quality of work, reliability, reputation, the          amount of work that would be performed, and a number of          other factors peculiar to each company. Shareholders          generally are not skilled to adequately decide upon these          factors, and the instant Proposal does not even attempt          to bring these factors to the shareholders&rsquo;          attention. Thus, as announced in the 1976 and 1998          Releases, Rule 14a-8(i)(7) was designed to exclude          proposals of the type submitted by Mr. Gabig.</p>
		      <p><strong>The Company may exclude the Proposal under Rule          14a-8(i)(1) because it is not a proper subject for action          by shareholders under the laws of the State of          Washington, the jurisdiction of the Company&rsquo;s          organization.</strong></p>
		      <p>Rule 14a-8(i)(1) allows a company to exclude a          proposal if it &quot;is not a proper subject for action          by shareholders under the laws of the jurisdiction of the          company&rsquo;s organization.&quot; The Company believes          that the Proposal deals it is not a proper subject for          action by shareholders under the laws of the State of          Washington, the jurisdiction of the Company&rsquo;s          organization because, under Washington law, shareholders          cannot require the Company to hire external consultants          or entirely eliminate the Company&rsquo;s management from          the process of selecting such consultants. Therefore, the          Company may properly exclude the Proposal under Rule          14a-8(i)(1).</p>
		      <p>The undersigned hereby opines that the Proposal, as          drafted, is not a proper subject for a shareholder action          under Washington law. Washington law vests all of the          corporation&rsquo;s management functions in its board of          directors. Rev.Code.Wash. (&quot;RCW&quot;)          23B.08.010(2). On the other hand, extraordinary          operations (such as amendment of the articles of          incorporation, RCW 23B.10.040; sale of all assets other          than in the ordinary course of business, RCW 23B.12.020;          merger, RCW 23B.11; and dissolution, RCW 23B.14.020) must          be approved by the shareholders. The Proposal is drafted          to require the Company to hire a proxy advisory firm and          is not drafted as a request or recommendation. The          Company&rsquo;s articles of incorporation do not limit the          authority of its Board of Directors relating to the          employment of external consultants. Thus, it is the          opinion of the undersigned that the Proposal contains an          action relating to a matter that Washington law reserves          for the board of directors. Therefore, the Proposal may          be excluded as not a proper subject for shareholder          action under Washington law.</p>
		      <p>In summary, for the reasons and on the basis of the          authorities cited above, the Company believes that it may          exclude the Proposal from the Company&rsquo;s proxy          materials for the 2000 annual meeting of shareholders          because it relates to the Company&rsquo;s ordinary          business operations, or alternatively, because it is not          a proper subject for shareholder action under Washington          law. The Company respectfully requests that the Division          not recommend any enforcement action to the Commission if          the Proposal is excluded. The Company is sending the          Proponent a copy of this submission, thus advising the          Proponent of the Company&rsquo;s intent to exclude the          Proposal from the proxy materials. If the Division has          any questions or comments regarding this submission,          please contact the undersigned at (206)-389-4264 or Leo          Batalov at (206)-389-6044.</p>
		      <p>Thank you for your consideration of these matters.</p>
		      <p>Very truly yours,</p>
