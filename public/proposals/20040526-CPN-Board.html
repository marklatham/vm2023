                  <p><strong>Board Statement in Opposition </strong></p>
                  <p>Each year, the Company undertakes the preparation of a proxy statement       and the solicitation of proxies from its stockholders in connection with       matters to be voted upon at its Annual Meeting of Stockholders to provide       stockholders, who are otherwise unable to attend the meeting, the       opportunity to vote their shares. In advance of the meeting, the Company       asks each stockholder to indicate his, her or its votes for each matter to       be voted upon on a proxy card and/or to indicate whether he, she or it plans       to attend the Annual Meeting. Each stockholder has the option to (i) vote on       each matter as he, she or it deems fit by completing the proxy and/or       attending the Annual Meeting in person, (ii) abstain from voting on any       given matter or (iii) abstain from voting altogether by not completing the       proxy and/or not attending the Annual Meeting. </p>
                  <p>In deciding how to vote on any given issue, the stockholder may consult       sources that he, she or it may find helpful, such as newspapers, business       periodicals or the Internet. In addition, the stockholder may also seek       guidance from organizations with whom the stockholder has a common interest,       such as trade associations, political organizations, religious organizations       and other groups. Many organizations prepare guidelines seeking to educate       the public and make recommendations on how stockholders should vote on       certain issues. In addition, some organizations prepare voting       recommendations targeting specific companies. The stockholder may also       choose to vote his, her or its shares in accordance with the recommendations       made by the Company. In any event, stockholders are always free to choose       the manner in which they will vote. </p>
                  <p>The stockholder proposal misguidedly suggests that the Company should       include in its annual proxy statement the voting recommendations of       institutional holders. The proposal does not provide any guidance as to how       this is to be accomplished nor discusses the additional costs associated       with such an endeavor, but rather imposes a burden on the Company&rsquo;s Board of       Directors to come up with a method for implementing a flawed proposal. </p>
                  <p>The proposal is not feasible<strong><a href="20040526-CPN-Board.html#1">1</a></strong>, because given the number of organizations       that purport to give stockholders voting guidance in any given year, the       Company would need to limit the number of organizations that it could       include in its proxy statement and has no rational way of choosing between       organizations. The Company would be in the position of having to endorse one       organization over another. </p>
                  <p>In addition, providing the voting recommendations of an organization       would require that the Company also include a statement of support from such       organization explaining its support for the recommendations.<strong><a href="20040526-CPN-Board.html#2">2</a></strong> The inclusion       of voting recommendations accompanied by statements of support prepared by       each organization creates the potential for false or misleading statements       since the Company would have no control over the resulting statements.       Moreover, adding voting recommendations accompanied by statements of support       to an already lengthy proxy statement would add a considerable number of       pages to which in turns leads to higher costs for the Company and its       stockholders.<strong><a href="20040526-CPN-Board.html#3">3</a></strong> </p>
                  <p>In sum, the Company believes that the stockholder proposal is unfeasible       as well as unnecessary and its implementation would undermine the long-term       interests of the stockholders by substantially increasing costs relating to       annual meetings.<strong><a href="20040526-CPN-Board.html#4">4</a></strong> </p>
                  <p><strong>The Board of Directors recommends a vote &ldquo;AGAINST&rdquo; the adoption of the       stockholder proposal regarding stockholder voting. </strong></p>

              <p><strong>PROPONENT'S RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE:</strong></p>
              <p><strong><a name="1" id="1">1</a>.</strong><strong> The   shareowner proposal asks for a study and report.&nbsp; The Board states: &quot;</strong>The   proposal is not feasible.&quot;&nbsp; Surely it is feasible to perform a study and   report.&nbsp; As for whether enabling shareowners to imitate institutional   voting decisions is feasible, that is what the proposed study would try to   determine.</p>
              <p>The Board seems to be arguing that enabling shareowners to imitate   institutional voting decisions is so obviously infeasible that a study would be   a waste of time and money.&nbsp; But there are many potential solutions to the   superficial problems imagined by the Board.&nbsp; For example, the Board could   investigate whether it would be legally permissible to offer the option to   imitate institutional voting via the internet only, not via the paper proxy.&nbsp;   Already the internet voting interface at <a href="http://www.proxyvote.com"> www.proxyvote.com</a> offers a voting mechanism different from the paper proxy:   a large, prominent button saying &quot;Vote my shares per directors'   recommendations&quot;.</p>
              <p>For many shareowners,   especially individual investors, the degree of convenience matters a great deal.&nbsp;   Individual investors are not legally required to vote their stock, so many of   them don't bother.&nbsp; And most who do vote, simply follow the Board's   conveniently displayed recommendations.&nbsp; This proposal would help level   that biased playing field.</p>
              <p><strong><a name="2" id="2">2</a>.</strong> I doubt that such a statement of support from the   Board would be legally required, considering that proposals such as mine appear   in the proxy without a statement of support from the Board.&nbsp; The Board's   study should check on this issue.</p>
              <p><strong><a name="3" id="3">3</a>.</strong> Again, an internet voting interface could solve   this problem by using links to more detailed information for those who desire   it.</p>
              <p><strong><a name="4" id="4">4</a>.</strong> For more on the benefits of these ideas, see the   working paper <strong><a href="http://www.corpmon.com/VoteYourStock.htm">&quot;Vote Your Stock&quot;</a></strong>.</p>
