		    <h3><strong>VOTING LEVERAGE  PROPOSAL </strong></h3>
		    <blockquote>
              <p>WHEREAS shareowners should have the right to vote any way     they want (except for buying and selling votes);</p>
		      <p>WHEREAS many individual shareowners lack the time and     expertise to make the best voting decisions themselves, yet prefer not to     always follow directors&rsquo; recommendations, because of possible conflicts of     interest;</p>
		      <p>WHEREAS several institutional investors now publish their     voting decisions more than one week before each company&rsquo;s voting deadline;</p>
		      <p>THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Visteon Corporation     shareowners request the Board of Directors to study and report on the     feasibility of enabling shareowners to conveniently imitate an institutional     investor&rsquo;s voting decisions.&nbsp; So for example, besides being offered a     convenient choice of voting the entire proxy as the Board recommends, perhaps     shareowners could be offered a similarly convenient choice of voting the     entire proxy the same way the Calvert Group votes its shares.</p>
		      <p><u>Supporting Statement:</u></p>
		      <p>Institutional investors that publish their voting     decisions on the worldwide web include:</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;- CalPERS (California Public Employees' Retirement     System) at <a href="http://www.calpers-governance.org/alert/proxy"> www.calpers-governance.org/alert/proxy</a></p>
		      <p>&nbsp;- Calvert Group at <a href="http://www.calvert.com/sri_2627.html">www.calvert.com/sri_2627.html</a></p>
		      <p>&nbsp;- Domini Social Investments at <a href="http://www.domini.com/shareholder-advocacy/Proxy-Voting"> www.domini.com/shareholder-advocacy/Proxy-Voting</a></p>
		      <p>&nbsp;- MMA Praxis Mutual Funds at <a href="http://www.mmapraxis.com/corporate/proxy_voting_set.html"> www.mmapraxis.com/corporate/proxy_voting_set.html</a></p>
		      <p>&nbsp;- Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan at <a href="http://www.otpp.com/web/website.nsf/web/cg+introduction"> www.otpp.com/web/website.nsf/web/cg+introduction</a></p>
		      <p>&nbsp;- Pax World Fund at <a href="http://www.paxfund.com/proxyvote4.htm">www.paxfund.com/proxyvote4.htm</a></p>
		      <p>In particular, Calvert Group and Domini Social     Investments published voting decisions for last year&rsquo;s Visteon Corporation     proxy.</p>
		      <p>One of the main reasons for having shareowner voting at     all is that there would be conflicts of interest inherent in leaving all     decisions to the Board.&nbsp; Simply following the Board&rsquo;s voting recommendations     does little to counterbalance such conflicts.&nbsp; Introducing competing sources     of convenient guidance for individual shareowners could help make voting more     independent of the Board.</p>
		      <p>The conflicts of interest among managers, directors and     shareowners are described in Robert Monks&rsquo; and Nell Minow&rsquo;s 1996 book <em> Watching the Watchers</em>, along with shareowners&rsquo; &ldquo;free rider&rdquo; and &ldquo;rational     ignorance&rdquo; problems.</p>
		      <p>The potential benefits of this proposal are discussed in     the article &ldquo;The Internet Will Drive Corporate Monitoring&rdquo; published in the     journal Corporate Governance     International (June 2000); also available on the web at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020203022306/www.corpmon.com/IntCM.htm">www.corpmon.com/IntCM.htm</a> .</p>
