		    <h3><strong>USEC BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION ON  THE</strong><strong> PROXY ADVISOR PROPOSAL </strong><strong></strong><strong>IN 2004  PROXY</strong> STATEMENT </h3>
		    <blockquote>

              <blockquote>
                  <p><strong>The Board of Directors opposes this shareholder proposal and       recommends that you vote against the proposal for the following reasons: </strong> </p>
                  <p>As discussed in more detail below, the Board of Directors believes that       the proposal would introduce an unwieldy new process to the Company&rsquo;s annual       proxy statement, is unnecessary to ensure that shareholders receive adequate       information, and could result in the Company&rsquo;s proxy statement being an open       forum for a self-styled proxy advisor to provide recommendations without any       restriction as to the content or quality thereof.<strong><a href="20040429-USU-Board.html#1">1</a></strong> The Board&rsquo;s position is based on the following reasons: </p>
                  <p>&bull; The proposal, if implemented, would impose the obligation on the       Company to hire a proxy advisory firm and to disseminate its       recommendations, without regard to the qualifications and experience of the       proxy advisory firm or the quality of its analysis of the issues presented.<strong><a href="20040429-USU-Board.html#2">2</a></strong> The proposal provides no means for the Company to ensure that shareholders       receive adequate information about the proxy advisory firms seeking to be       selected<strong><a href="20040429-USU-Board.html#3">3</a></strong> or that the voting advice       presented by such firms is based on informed analysis and is not false and       misleading.<strong><a href="20040429-USU-Board.html#4">4</a></strong> </p>
                  <p>&bull; The USEC Board of Directors is composed of eight experienced       individuals, six of whom are independent directors. The Board believes that       it is in the best position to provide shareholders with informed       recommendations with respect to matters presented for shareholder vote. The       Board of Directors has a deeper understanding of the many complex issues       that impact decision-making with respect to this very unique corporation       than an unsupervised proxy advisory firm can be expected to have.<strong><a href="20040429-USU-Board.html#5">5</a> </strong></p>
                  <p>&bull; The proposal does not require any minimum qualifications or experience       for a proxy advisory firm to put itself on the ballot.<strong><a href="20040429-USU-Board.html#6">6</a></strong> Moreover, it does not give the Company the ability to limit the number of       self-styled proxy advisory firms that could elect to place themselves on the       ballot.<strong><a href="20040429-USU-Board.html#7">7</a></strong> In the event a large number of       firms place themselves on the Company&rsquo;s ballot, the vote could be unwieldy,       and the winning firm could receive much less than a majority vote.<strong><a href="20040429-USU-Board.html#8">8</a></strong> This means that the Company&rsquo;s proxy statement could become an open forum for       a potentially unqualified entity chosen by a minority of the Company&rsquo;s       shareholders. </p>
                  <p>&bull; Shareholders have access to a wide variety of resources and opinions       regarding the types of matters that are typically presented for shareholder       vote. The Board believes that engaging a proxy advisory firm through the       process described in the proposal is not beneficial to shareholders and is       not a prudent use of corporate funds.<strong><a href="20040429-USU-Board.html#9">9</a></strong> </p>
                  <p>For the foregoing reasons we do not believe that this proposal is in the       best interests of the Company or its Shareholders. </p>
                  <p><strong>The Board recommends voting AGAINST this proposal, which is designated       as Proposal Number 5 on the enclosed proxy.</strong></p>

              <p><strong>PROPONENT'S RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE:</strong></p>
              <p><a name="1" id="1"><strong>1</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Only advisors selected   by USEC shareowner vote would be able to provide recommendations in the proxy,   so this would not be an &quot;open forum&quot; -- only as open as shareowners want to make   it.&nbsp; It is true that <em>the Board</em> would not be able to impose any   restriction as to the content of this advice.&nbsp; This is to prevent pro-Board   bias in the advice.&nbsp; Quality control would come from an advisor's need to   maintain its reputation for serving shareowner interests.</p>
              <p><a name="2" id="2"><strong>2</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Shareowners would vote   to choose a proxy advisor with regard to its qualifications and experience and   the quality of its analysis track record.</p>
              <p><a name="3" id="3"><strong>3</strong></a><strong>.</strong> I agree that shareowners will   need adequate information about the advisory firms seeking to be selected.&nbsp;   There are so many potential sources for this information that the proposal does   not need to specifically &quot;provide&quot; such means.&nbsp; But the proposal does   provide for advisory firms to give information about themselves.&nbsp; Of course   such information may have a self-interested bias.&nbsp; (Compare this with the   information provided in the proxy regarding director elections.)&nbsp; However,   the Board would also be free to include in the proxy its own recommendations and   information regarding which proxy advisor to choose, providing some balance to   the process.&nbsp; But most important, shareowners would choose proxy advisory   firms with reputations for serving shareowner interests.&nbsp; Such brand   reputations would be based on evaluation and discussion by the broad financial   community.&nbsp; By contrast, brand reputation is not a practical mechanism for   individual director quality, since there are so many directors in the USA and   each one has a limited track record in terms of years and number of firms   served.</p>
              <p><a name="4" id="4"><strong>4</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Again, these important   quality issues would be handled by shareowners based on each advisor's   reputation in the financial community.&nbsp; Board influence on advisor   selection would undermine the advisor's independence.</p>
              <p><a name="5" id="5"><strong>5</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The Board's insight and   advice on proxy matters are indeed valuable.&nbsp; Shareowners would continue to   benefit from the Board's advice <em>in addition to</em> that of an independent   proxy advisory firm.</p>
              <p><a name="6" id="6"><strong>6</strong></a><strong>.</strong> See note 4 above.</p>
              <p><a name="7" id="7"><strong>7</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The proposal gives the   Company the ability to limit the number of proxy advisory firms on the ballot by   requiring an entry fee.&nbsp; The amount of the fee can be adjusted to keep this   number manageable.&nbsp; To further encourage legitimate candidates and   discourage others, the fee could be refunded to any candidate receiving more   than (for example) 10% of the vote.</p>
              <p><strong><a name="8" id="8">8</a>.</strong> I agree it is undesirable for a voting   system to allow winning with only a minority of the votes.&nbsp; This can be   prevented by using a preferential voting system where voters rank the candidates   -- see <a href="http://www.corpmon.com/VotingReform.htm"> www.corpmon.com/VotingReform.htm</a> .</p>
              <p><strong><a name="9" id="9">9</a>.</strong> The cost of voting advice is very small compared   with the amount of shareowner funds at stake in proxy voting matters.&nbsp;   Also, some shareowners now pay for proxy voting advice, but such advice only   goes to those who pay for it.&nbsp; Under this proposal, all shareowners would   receive the advice and all would share in paying for it, thus eliminating the   &quot;free rider&quot; problem.</p>
