              <p>Re: <strong><u>Shareowner Proposal of Mark Latham to Citigroup</u></strong></p>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>
              <p>I am writing in response to the December 22, 1999 letter      and supporting material (the &quot;Citigroup      Submission&quot;) submitted to the Commission by Citigroup      Inc. (&quot;Citigroup&quot; or the &quot;Company&quot;),      which expresses the Company&rsquo;s intention to omit from its      proxy statement for the 2000 annual meeting a shareowner      proposal (the &quot;Proposal&quot;) submitted by me. The      Proposal (attached) asks the shareowners to request the      Company to hire for one year a proxy advisory firm to be      chosen by the shareowners.</p>
              <p>The Citigroup Submission cites Rules 14a-8(i)(7)      (&lsquo;ordinary business&rsquo;), 14a-8(i)(4) (&lsquo;personal      interest&rsquo;) and 14a-8(i)(3) (&lsquo;false and      misleading&rsquo;) as bases for its request for relief from      enforcement action. I suggest below some revisions to the      Proposal, primarily to maintain consistently precatory      language. (The resulting &quot;Revised Proposal&quot; is      attached.) For the reasons given below, I believe the Revised      Proposal may not be properly omitted under Rule 14a-8. Most      of these reasons would apply equally well to the (original)      Proposal.</p>
              <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Suggested revisions to the Proposal</u></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>1. The Proposal is intended to be precatory. In order          to clarify this, I suggest changing its wording to          maintain consistently precatory language by:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>(a) replacing &quot;RESOLVED that the Company              hire&quot; with &quot;RESOLVED that Citigroup              shareowners request the Board of Directors to              hire&quot;;</p>
                  <p>(b) consequently simplifying the next sentence by              replacing &quot;Citigroup shareowners request the              Board of Directors to take&quot; with              &quot;Shareowners request the Board to take&quot;;              and</p>
                  <p>(c) in the subsequent part of the resolution              (before the supporting statement), replace              &quot;can&quot; with &quot;could&quot;, and replace              &quot;is&quot; with &quot;would be&quot; (see              attached Revised Proposal for exact wording), thus              indicating that it is all conditional on the              Board&rsquo;s decisions.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>2. I recently heard from the editor of the journal <em>Gouvernance</em> that my article entitled &quot;The Internet Will Drive          Corporate Monitoring&quot; will not be in their Winter          2000 issue as had been planned, but is slated for their          Spring 2000 issue instead. Since references to future          publications can not be considered guaranteed, I suggest          deleting the reference to <em>Gouvernance</em>, as in the          attached Revised Proposal.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Rule 14a-8(i)(7) -- &lsquo;ordinary business&rsquo;</u></strong></p>
              <blockquote>
                <p><u>Summary:</u></p>
                <p>1. The Revised Proposal is designed to improve          corporate governance, which is not an ordinary business          matter.</p>
                <p>2. The Revised Proposal asks for the hiring of a proxy          advisory firm, but would not restrict the Company from          hiring any other external consultants. So it would not          interfere with the Company&rsquo;s ordinary business          operations.</p>
                <p>3. Choosing a proxy advisory firm is well within the          capabilities of shareowners. It is easier than voting          intelligently on compensation plans, director candidates,          and most other proposals. On these more complex matters,          shareowners will be better able to vote with the benefit          of independent advice if the Revised Proposal is          implemented.</p>
                <p>4. Unlike <em>Johnson Controls, Inc.</em> (October 26,          1999) and <em>Bob Evans Farms, Inc.</em> (June 23, 1997),          the Revised Proposal would relate exclusively to          shareowner voting, and thus not to ordinary business          matters.</p>
                <p><u>Detail:</u></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>This is a corporate governance proposal. While the Company      may hire consultants as part of its ordinary business, the      Revised Proposal would in effect enable shareowners to hire      consultants (a proxy advisory firm). The Revised Proposal      would not prevent the Company from hiring consultants, so it      does not interfere with the Company&rsquo;s ordinary business      operations. The Citigroup Submission thus makes an overly      broad interpretation of Rule 14a-8(i)(7).</p>
              <p>Rule 14a-8(i) is part of a tradeoff between enabling      shareowners to have a voice in appropriate ways on the one      hand, and excluding counterproductive uses of the proposal      mechanism on the other. Rule 14a-8(i)(7), the &lsquo;ordinary      business&rsquo; exclusion, is more specifically about the      tradeoff between shareowner voice and excess micro-management      of decisions better left to management. The problem of      optimizing this tradeoff is exactly what the Revised Proposal      is designed to solve. Choosing a proxy advisory firm will be      an easier decision for shareowners than other matters they      are asked to vote on, including compensation plans,      directors, and most proposals. Once a proxy advisor has been      hired, shareholders are likely to be better informed and      better prepared to vote on other proxy issues.</p>
              <p>Most institutional investors are aware of the reputations      of proxy advisory firms, but most individual investors are      not. However, individuals will quickly and easily learn those      reputations if the Revised Proposal is implemented. That will      happen in much the same way that consumers have learned how      to buy personal computers (PCs). Before PCs became a      mass-market product, most consumers knew little about them or      their manufacturers&rsquo; reputations. But when many people      became interested in buying them, they did not have to be      electrical engineers to be able to choose good quality PCs.      Reviews in the media assessed and compared PC brand      reputations. Availability of this information and competition      among brands have brought great responsiveness to customer      needs.</p>
              <p>This evolution of media coverage will happen much faster      for proxy advisory firm reputations than it did for PC      makers, because the advisory business is already well      established, and advisor reputations are well known among      institutional investors. They need only be communicated to      individuals by the media.</p>
              <p>A key factor here is the number of major PC brands. If      there were hundreds, it would not be practical for consumers      to learn all their reputations. Likewise for proxy advisory      firms: this system will work because there are not too many      of them. By contrast, director elections rarely provide an      effective voice for shareowners, because potential director      candidates nationwide for board seats at companies in a      typical investor&rsquo;s portfolio number in the hundreds. SEC      Release 34-40018 (May 21, 1998) states that the      &lsquo;ordinary business&rsquo; rule is designed to exclude      proposals &quot;probing too deeply into matters of a complex      nature upon which shareholders, as a group, would not be in a      position to make an informed judgment&quot;. It is easier to      make an informed judgment about proxy advisory firms than      about directors. Since shareholders are expected to vote on      directors, they must be in an even better position to vote on      advisory firms.</p>
              <p>Similarly, analyzing a stock-option plan is complex for      the typical individual investor. Like many institutional      investors, they will benefit from an independent analysis to      aid their voting. Thus the Revised Proposal would give      shareowners much more informed and effective voice.</p>
              <p>In <em>Johnson Controls, Inc.</em> (October 26, 1999),      Commission staff &quot;determined that proposals requesting      additional disclosures in Commission-prescribed documents      should not be omitted under the &lsquo;ordinary business&rsquo;      exclusion solely because they relate to the preparation and      content of documents filed with or submitted to the      Commission. &hellip;we therefore will consider whether the      subject matter of the additional disclosure sought in a      particular proposal involves a matter of ordinary business;      where it does, we believe it may be excluded under rule      14a-8(i)(7).&quot; The Revised Proposal would involve      including information in proxy materials that relates only to      shareowner voting. Matters of ordinary business are not put      to shareowner vote. Thus the subject matter of the additional      disclosure will not be ordinary business, so is not grounds      for exclusion.</p>
              <p>In <em>Bob Evans Farms, Inc.</em> (June 23, 1997), a      shareowner proposed that the company hire a consulting firm      to advise the board and management how to improve the      company&rsquo;s financial performance. In contrast, the      Revised Proposal here seeks advice for shareowners on voting.      Again, matters of ordinary business are not put to shareowner      vote, so this advice would not relate to ordinary business.</p>
              <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Rule 14a-8(i)(4) -- &lsquo;personal interest&rsquo;</u></strong></p>
              <p>The Revised Proposal raises issues of conflict of      interest, so it&rsquo;s only fair that my own potential      conflicts should also be scrutinized.</p>
              <p>The entire design of the Revised Proposal is for the      benefit of Citigroup shareowners. Any potential benefit to me      is incidental. Therefore the Revised Proposal is not designed      to result in a benefit, nor designed to further a personal      interest, not shared by the other shareholders at large.</p>
              <p>The Revised Proposal is neutral not only on its face, but      also in design and substance. Its design is based on economic      analysis of the agency relationship between shareowners and      managers. That analysis is presented in several articles      published in leading journals specialized in corporate      governance and investment management, including <em>Financial      Analysts Journal</em> and <em>Corporate Governance: An      International Review</em>. A complete listing with full      references to the articles (and downloadable text for many)      is on the web at http://www.corpmon.com/publications.htm .      The article entitled &quot;Collective Action for Dispersed      Shareowners&quot; in <em>Corporate Governance International</em> is probably the most directly relevant here.</p>
              <p>The Revised Proposal is aimed squarely at solving the      &quot;free-rider problem&quot;, which reduces the incentive      of any one shareowner to monitor management (by intelligent      voting), even though shareowners as a group would benefit      substantially if they all undertook such monitoring. Acting      as a group to hire a voting advisor would avoid much of the      free-rider problem, as explained in more detail in the      Revised Proposal and articles mentioned above.</p>
              <p>References in the Revised Proposal to websites and      published articles show shareowners where to find further      relevant information than can be conveyed within the 500-word      limit.</p>
              <p>While the main point of this rebuttal is that the Revised      Proposal&rsquo;s design is entirely to benefit Citigroup      shareowners, here is some further evidence that I have no      commercial interest in the Revised Proposal that deviates      from Citigroup shareowners&rsquo; interests:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>1. I have no commercial tie to any proxy advisory          firm.</p>
                <p>2. There is no paid advertising on the Corporate          Monitoring website.</p>
                <p>3. My commercial interests are disclosed at          http://www.corpmon.com/Commercial.htm , including the          sentence: &quot;If the idea is successful, I expect to          have opportunities for consulting or full-time employment          at businesses involved in corporate monitoring, at          regulatory agencies like the SEC, and for research at          institutes or universities.&quot; Such opportunities          would only arise if the Revised Proposal is successful in          helping shareowners, thus enhancing my professional          reputation. This is much like the situation where doing a          good job at the SEC enhances your professional          reputation, which in turn may help your subsequent          career. That possibility does not imply that you are          slanting your decisions now to improve your subsequent          career. Any successful undertaking, especially if          public-spirited, can enhance one&rsquo;s reputation and          career.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>But speaking of interests that are not shared by Citigroup      shareholders at large, consider management&rsquo;s interest in      maintaining their influence over the votes of individual      investors. The reason why we have shareowner voting at all is      that there are conflicts inherent in leaving all decisions to      management.</p>
              <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Rule 14a-8(i)(3) -- &lsquo;false and misleading&rsquo;</u></strong></p>
              <p>(For this section, it is simpler and clearer to refer to      the Proposal rather than the Revised Proposal, because of      references to the Citigroup Submission. But all the arguments      are equally applicable to both versions.)</p>
              <p>The Proposal&rsquo;s first clause refers to a well known      and pervasive problem, confirmed again and again in my      conversations with investors and proxy voting industry      specialists. The wording is carefully qualified so as not to      be overly sweeping, thus substantially understating the case: <em>many</em> shareowners [not all, not even claiming most]      lack the time&hellip;to make the <em>best</em> voting decisions      [though they may be able to make good decisions], prefer not      to <em>always</em> follow [allows that they might be happy to      follow 99% of the time, although I doubt it],      management&rsquo;s <em>possible</em> conflicts [not claiming      management necessarily even has conflicts, although they      clearly do, for example in determining their compensation].      References in the Proposal to websites and published articles      give interested shareowners convenient access to evidence      supporting this and all other statements in the Proposal.</p>
              <p>The Proposal&rsquo;s second clause does not suggest, as      claimed in the Citigroup Submission, that &quot;every      candidate willing&hellip;has established a      reputation&hellip;&quot; It is obvious to anyone that merely      paying an entry fee and offering services does not mean that      an advisor has an established reputation. Criteria for      determining the reputation of professional service providers      are too complex to present as part of a 500-word proposal,      but all shareowners have some familiarity with how such      reputations are determined in general. Everyone reading      business newspapers or magazines learns about the reputations      of companies and people in many fields. One need not infer      that both individual and institutional investors share the      same interests. Proxy advisory firms could in fact make      different recommendations to different types of investors.      Furthermore, note that Citigroup management routinely makes      the same recommendations on how Citigroup shareowners should      vote their stock to both individual and institutional      investors.</p>
              <p>The supporting statement&rsquo;s introductory clause,      &quot;This proposal can be expected to&hellip;&quot;, provides      an important qualification to the rest of that paragraph,      including the four bullet points. All that is being claimed      is that some observers may expect these outcomes. My own      belief is actually stronger than that: I think these      expectations are very reasonable.</p>
              <p>If the proxy advisory firm pays printing and mailing      costs, such costs would be built into its fee for providing      advisory services, so in effect the Company (and thus      shareowners) would be paying them anyway. So that is not an      important distinction when considering the overall merit of      the Proposal. There are of course many such practical details      that would need to be determined in the course of      implementing the Proposal. Competition among advisory firms      to build reputations for benefiting shareowners, will be a      pervasive force providing reasonable answers to such      questions as how frequently communications to shareowners      should be made.</p>
              <p>The Citigroup Submission describes as misleading this      section of the Proposal&rsquo;s supporting statement:      &quot;The Proposal can be expected to improve the return of      Citigroup stock by: enhancing management accountability to      shareowners by making professionally researched advice      available to all; effectively enfranchising individual      investors for the first time, ensuring that a majority of      shares can be voted independently of management&rsquo;s      recommendations; and encouraging greater competition among      advisory firms to serve shareowner interests.&quot; These      statements are reasonable, and well supported in the articles      referenced in the Proposal&rsquo;s last paragraph.</p>
              <p>If the Commission staff nonetheless considers any part of      the Proposal or Supporting Statement to be false or      misleading, I would be willing to delete such part.</p>
              <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
              <p>Based on the foregoing, I respectfully request that the      Commission staff find that Citigroup lacks sufficient grounds      for excluding the Revised Proposal from its proxy statement.
