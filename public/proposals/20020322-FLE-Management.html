		      <p>Re: <em>Stockholder Proposal      Submitted by Mark Latham </em></p>
		      <p>Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>
		      <p>We are writing on behalf of      our client, Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc., a Delaware      corporation (&quot;Fleetwood&quot; or the      &quot;Company&quot;), and hereby request confirmation that      the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance (the      &quot;Staff&quot;) of the Securities and Exchange Commission      (the &quot;SEC&quot;) will not recommend any enforcement      action if, in reliance on certain provisions of Rule 14a-8      under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the      &quot;Exchange Act&quot;), Fleetwood excludes a proposal (the      &quot;Proposal&quot;) submitted by Mark Latham (the      &quot;Proponent&quot;) from the Company&rsquo;s proxy      materials for the 2002 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the      &quot;Proxy Materials&quot;).</p>
		      <p>In accordance with Rule      14a-8(j), we are furnishing you with six copies of (1) this      letter which outlines Fleetwood&rsquo;s reasons for excluding      the Proposal from its Proxy Materials, (2) correspondence      between the Company and the Proponent and (3) the      Proponent&rsquo;s letter setting forth the Proposal, including      the attachments thereto. We also are sending a copy of this      letter to the Proponent as notice of the Company&rsquo;s      intention to omit the Proposal from its Proxy Materials.      Fleetwood plans to file its definitive Proxy Materials with      the Commission on or after July 15, 2002. We respectfully      request that you advise the Company with respect to the      Proposal at your earliest convenience.</p>
		      <p><strong>The Proposal</strong></p>
		      <p><strong>The Proposal is word for      word the same (except for the names of the companies) as a      proposal submitted by the same Proponent last year to      SONICblue Inc. (the &quot;Identical Proposal&quot;) and which      the SEC has already considered. </strong><strong><em>See </em></strong><strong><u>SONICblue      Inc</u></strong><strong>. (March 23, 2001) (&quot;SONICblue&quot;).</strong></p>
		      <p>The Proponent submitted his      Proposal for presentation at Fleetwood&rsquo;s next annual      meeting by letter dated January 25. In accordance with Rule      14a-8(f), Fleetwood sent a letter to the Proponent dated      February 7, 2002,      requesting information necessary to determine whether the      Proponent satisfied the eligibility requirements set forth in      Rule 14a-8(b) and to request that the Proponent omit      reference in the Proposal to his Web site as a source for      further information concerning the Proposal in accordance      with the procedural requirements of Rule 14a-8(d). By letter      dated February 20, 2002, Proponent provided Fleetwood with      information regarding his eligibility pursuant to Rule      14a-8(b) and declined to revise the Proposal to remove      reference to the Web site.</p>
		      <p>The Proposal requests that      the Board allow the stockholders annually to select the      Company&rsquo;s independent auditors. In <u>SONICblue</u>, the      Staff granted the company&rsquo;s request for no-action advice      stating that the Identical Proposal could be omitted under      Rule 14a-8(i)(7). As was the case with SONICblue, Inc.,      Fleetwood believes that the Proposal at issue may be omitted      from its Proxy materials, or if included it should be      modified, based on the following reasons, as more fully      discussed below:</p>
		      <blockquote>
                <p>1. Rule 14a-8(i)(7),          because the Proposal deals with a matter relating to          Fleetwood&rsquo;s ordinary business operations;</p>
		        <p>2. Rule 14a-8(i)(1),          because the Proposal concerns a subject upon which          stockholders may not properly take action under the laws          of the State of Delaware, Fleetwood&rsquo;s state of          incorporation;</p>
		        <p>3. Rule 14a-8(i)(3),          because the Proposal is so vague and indefinite as to be          materially false and misleading under Rule 14a-9; and</p>
		        <p>4. Rule 14a-8(i)(3),          because the Proposal incorporates irrelevant information          that is materially false and misleading under Rule 14a-9.</p>
	          </blockquote>
		      <p><strong>Reasons for Omission of      the Proposal</strong></p>
		      <p><strong>1. </strong><strong><em>The Proposal      deals with a matter relating to Fleetwood&rsquo;s ordinary      business operations and, therefore, may be excluded under      Rule 14a-8(i)(7).</em></strong></p>
		      <p>Fleetwood may exclude the      Proposal pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(7), which permits the      omission of proposals that deal with matters relating to the      company&rsquo;s ordinary business operations. As described      above, the Proposal at issue is identical to the proposal      submitted by this same Proponent in <u>SONICblue</u>. The      Staff granted the registrant&rsquo;s no-action request in <u>SONICblue</u> providing that the registrant had a basis for excluding the      Identical Proposal, as a matter &quot;relating to [the      company&rsquo;s] ordinary business operations <em>(i.e., </em>the      method of selecting independent auditors).&quot; Accordingly,      the Staff stated that it would not recommend enforcement      action if the registrant omitted the Identical Proposal under      Rule 14a-8(i)(7).</p>
		      <p>In several other recent      no-action letters, the Staff has affirmed that the method of      selecting independent auditors is a matter relating to a      company&rsquo;s ordinary business operations. <em>See </em><u>Community      Bancshares, Inc</u>. (March 15, 1999) (proposal requesting      that the company&rsquo;s bylaws be amended to require that its      independent auditors be a regional or national certified      accounting firm and be selected by an independent audit      committee); <u>Excalibur Technologies Corporation</u> (May 4,      1998) (proposal requesting that the appointment of      independent auditors be subject to stockholder approval); <u>LTV      Corp</u>. (December 22, 1997) (proposal requesting that the      board disclose certain financial information of the      company&rsquo;s auditors in the proxy statement); <u>Occidental      Petroleum Corporation</u> (January 22, 1997) (proposal      requesting that the board provide information regarding the      financial capacity of the company&rsquo;s independent auditors      to pay claims for malpractice, negligence and fraud); <u>Transamerica      Corporation</u> (March 8, 1996). (proposal requiring new      auditors every four-years).</p>
		      <p>We note that this      long-standing approach contrasts with the Staffs reaction to      the entirely distinct issue raised by proposals to prohibit      an auditing firm from providing non-audit services. <em>See </em><u>Motorola      Inc</u>. (January 16, 2002); <u>Ameren Corp</u>. (January 14,      2002); <em>see also </em><u>The Walt Disney Company</u> (December 18, 2001). The Staff explained in <u>Ameren Corp</u>.      that such proposals may not be omitted &quot;in view of the      widespread public debate concerning the impact of non-audit      services on auditor independence and the increasing      recognition that this issue raises significant policy      issues.&quot; This issue of the impact of non-audit services      on auditor independence is entirely different from issue      presented by the Proposal, which involves the method of      selecting independent auditors.</p>
		      <p>Fleetwood respectfully      submits that the responsibility of selecting its independent      auditors is a matter of the Company&rsquo;s ordinary business.      Such responsibility rests in the hands of Fleetwood&rsquo;s      board of directors (the &quot;Board&quot;) in managing the      business and affairs of the Company. In carrying out its      responsibilities, Fleetwood has established an independent      audit committee (the &quot;Audit Committee&quot;) which,      unless the Board has otherwise directed, has authority to      select, evaluate and, if appropriate, remove the      Company&rsquo;s independent auditors. Further, Fleetwood has      adopted an Audit Committee Charter (the &quot;Charter&quot;)      that details the qualifications for membership of the      Committee, including independence and financial literacy, and      specifically defines the detailed responsibilities of the      members, including reviewing and analyzing the independence      and responsiveness of the Company&rsquo;s auditors. In further      evaluating the performance of the auditors, the Audit      Committee will consider the auditors&rsquo; expertise and      resources, and also the time and resources required to      acquaint new auditors with the Company and its procedures.      Because of the need to evaluate these and other factors, and      because of the expertise and independence Fleetwood requires      of those directors who perform that evaluation, it is      reasonable and appropriate that the selection of the      Company&rsquo;s independent auditors fall within the purview      of the Board and the Audit Committee as part of the      Company&rsquo;s ordinary business operations.</p>
		      <p>In addition, under NYSE Rule      303.01, the Company&rsquo;s Audit Committee must consist of at      least three directors who are independent of the      Company&rsquo;s management and who must be able to read and      understand financial statements. NYSE Rule 303.01 also      requires each U.S.-listed company to adopt a written audit      committee charter which must specify that, among other      matters, (i) the outside auditors are ultimately accountable      to the board of directors and the audit committee, (ii) the      ultimate authority and responsibility to select, evaluate,      and, where appropriate, replace the outside auditors is      vested in the board and audit committee, and (iii) the audit      committee will ensure that the outside auditors periodically      provide formal written statements regarding all relationships      with the company&mdash;whereby the audit committee will then      review such statements and open up a dialogue with the      outside auditors regarding all such disclosed relationships      or services that may impact the objectivity and independence      of the company&rsquo;s outside auditors&mdash;and then make      appropriate recommendations to the board in response.</p>
		      <p>The NYSE audit committee      provisions place ultimate responsibility for the selection of      independent auditors on the board of directors and the audit      committee. The Proposal at issue, contrary to the NYSE audit      committee provisions and the Company&rsquo;s Charter, allows      &quot;any qualified auditing firm&quot; to &quot;put itself      on the ballot,&quot; as stated in paragraph 3 of the      Proposal. Therefore, the Proposal, if adopted, would conflict      with the Board and the Audit Committee&rsquo;s conduct of      ordinary business operations, including overseeing, removing,      selecting or recommending auditors, as required under NYSE      Rule 303.01 and the Company&rsquo;s Charter.</p>
		      <p><strong>2. </strong><strong><em>Under Delaware law, the      Proposal is not a proper subject for stockholder action and      may be excluded </em></strong><strong><em>pursuant      to Rule 14a-8 (i) (1).</em></strong></p>
		      <p>In addition, Fleetwood may      omit the Proposal from its Proxy Materials pursuant to Rule      14a-8(i)(1) which permits the omission of a stockholder      proposal that is not a proper subject for stockholder action      under the laws of the company&rsquo;s state of incorporation.      The Proposal, if adopted, would mandate that the stockholders      annually elect the Company&rsquo;s independent auditors and      thereby improperly intrudes upon the Board&rsquo;s authority.</p>
		      <p>The Note to Rule 14a-8(i)(1)      states that some proposals are not considered proper under      state law if they would be binding on the company if approved      by stockholders. The Staff has interpreted this position to      mean that the board has exclusive discretion in corporate      matters, unless a specific provision in a state&rsquo;s      corporate code or in the corporation&rsquo;s charter or bylaws      states otherwise. <em>See </em>Securities and Exchange Act      Release No. 34-12999 (November 22, 1976); <em>see also </em><u>Pay      Less Drug Stores</u> (April 11, 1975) (proposal may be      omitted where California Corporations Code does not      specifically provide for stockholder decisions regarding      selection of the company&rsquo;s independent auditors).</p>
		      <p>Fleetwood is a Delaware      corporation. No provision in Fleetwood&rsquo;s bylaws, its      Certificate of Incorporation, or the Delaware General      Corporation Law (the &quot;DGCL&quot;) vests the stockholders      with the power to select the Company&rsquo;s independent      auditors. To the contrary, Section 141(a) of the DGCL      provides that the business and affairs of the corporation      shall be managed by or under the direction of its board of      directors, unless its bylaws or certificate of incorporation      state otherwise. Fleetwood&rsquo;s bylaws specifically provide      that the business and affairs of the Company shall be managed      by the Board. In addition, Section 122(5) of the DGCL      provides the corporation with the power to &quot;appoint such      officers and agents as the business of the corporation      requires.&quot; In this regard, Fleetwood&rsquo;s stockholders      have elected the Board and thereby empowered it with the      authority and responsibility to manage the Company&rsquo;s      business and affairs.</p>
		      <p>The Staff has previously      affirmed the position that, where a state&rsquo;s corporate      code:</p>
		      <p>(i) vests the company with      the power to choose corporate agents and (ii) provides that      the board shall, subject to the company&rsquo;s articles or      bylaws, have the corporate power to control the      company&rsquo;s business and affairs&mdash;a company is then      permitted to exclude a stockholder proposal that deals with      the method of selecting its independent auditors as an      encroachment on the board&rsquo;s authority. <em>See </em><u>Pay      Less Drug Stores</u> (April 11, 1975) (citing from the      California Corporations Code). In a no-action letter issued      to <u>Pay Less Drug Stores</u>, the Staff stated that it      would not recommend enforcement action if the company      excluded a stockholder proposal that provided for an      individual stockholder nominating the company&rsquo;s      auditors. The Staff took the position that there was some      basis for excluding the proposal in <u>Pay Less Drug Stores</u> as not a proper subject for stockholder action under      California law. Parallel with the provisions of      California&rsquo;s Corporations Code cited in <u>Pay Less Drug      Stores</u>, the DGCL utilizes analogous language to empower      the board in handling a corporation&rsquo;s business and      affairs and in selecting corporate agents. Similar to <u>Pay      Less Drug Stores</u>, the Proposal at issue contravenes      Delaware law and is thus not a proper subject for stockholder      action.</p>
		      <p>We respectfully submit that      absent any provision in the DGCL, Fleetwood&rsquo;s Bylaws or      its Certificate of Incorporation, the Board holds the      exclusive power to select its independent auditors, with the      authority to delegate that power to the Audit Committee of      the Board.</p>
		      <p><strong>3. </strong><strong><em>The Proposal is so vague      and indefinite as to be materially false and misleading under      Rule 14a-9 </em></strong><strong><em>and,      therefore, may be excluded under Rule 14a-8 (i) (3).</em></strong></p>
		      <p>Fleetwood also may exclude      the Proposal pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(3) which provides for      the omission of proposals that are contrary to any of the      SEC&rsquo;s proxy rules, including Rule 14a-9, which prohibits      materially false or misleading statements in proxy soliciting      materials. The Staff has previously taken the position that      proposals deemed vague and indefinite are misleading under      Rule 14a-9 and, therefore, excludable under Rule 14a-8(i)(3).</p>
		      <p>In a no-action letter issued      to <u>Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation </u>(November 29,      1993), the Staff granted the registrant&rsquo;s request for      no-action advice with respect to its decision to exclude a      stockholder&rsquo;s proposal because the proposal was      ambiguous as to the criteria for selection of the auditors,      the voting process by which the auditors should be chosen,      and the effect the proposal would have on the board in the      event of an affirmative vote. In <u>Connecticut Natural Gas      Corporation</u>, the stockholder proposal did not address or      set any standards for the selection of auditors, and further,      it failed to provide rules for the voting process.</p>
		      <p>Similarly, the Proposal at      issue is vague and indefinite as to both the standards for      selecting auditors and voting procedures. The Proposal fails      to provide any criteria for the selection of auditors or      provide for the manner in which auditors might appear on the      ballot. Rather, the Proponent states merely that any      &quot;qualified&quot; accounting firm could place itself on      the ballot. Fleetwood&rsquo;s business requires the services      of an accounting firm with sophisticated knowledge and      experience. The Proposal fails to define or address what      &quot;qualified&quot; entails and whether      &quot;qualified&quot; includes only members of the &quot;big      five&quot; accounting firms or whether any accounting firm      would suffice. Further, in order to qualify, must the      Company&rsquo;s Audit Committee first evaluate and interview      the candidates? If not, the Company would not be in      compliance with NYSE Rule 303.01 or its Charter, as described      above.</p>
		      <p>In addition, the Proposal      fails to describe the voting process for selecting the      independent auditors&mdash;particularly what would happen in      the event that three or more accounting firms have placed      themselves on the ballot. Under Section 216 of the DGCL and      in conjunction with the Company&rsquo;s Certificate of      Incorporation and Bylaws, stockholder action, other than the      election of directors, requires an affirmative vote of a      majority of the shares present or represented at the meeting      and entitled to vote on the subject matter. If there are      three or more accounting firms on the ballot and no firm      receives a majority of such votes, then any such selection      would be invalid and would not constitute action by the      stockholders. Thus, absent any other voting procedures, the      Proposal could leave Fleetwood without any independent      auditors.</p>
		      <p>The Company respectfully      submits that the Proposal&rsquo;s deficiencies render the      Proposal so vague and indefinite as to violate Rule 14a-9.</p>
		      <p><strong><em>4. The Proposal      includes reference to the Proponent&rsquo;s Web site as a      source for additional information on the Proposal, but the      Web site incorporates irrelevant information that is      materially false and misleading under Rule 14a-9 and,      therefore, reference to the Web site may be excluded under      Rule 14a-8(i) (3).</em></strong></p>
		      <p>The Proponent includes his      Web site address, &quot;corpmon.com,&quot; in the supporting      statement to the Proposal as a source for additional      information. The Staff has indicated that a Web site which is      referenced in a proposal or supporting statement and provides      irrelevant information that is materially false or misleading      or otherwise contravenes the proxy rules may be excluded      under Rule 14a-8(i)(3). <em>See </em>Staff Legal Bulletin No.      14, Questions and Answers C.2.b. and F.1. (July 13, 2001).</p>
		      <p>The Proponent&rsquo;s Web site      includes information that is entirely irrelevant to the      Proposal and that impermissibly expands on its scope.      Specifically, a substantial portion of the Proponent&rsquo;s      Web site, as of March 19, 2002, addresses proposals regarding      the use of proxy advisory firms, which bear no relation to      the subject matter of the Proposal. In this regard, the      Proponent discusses stockholder voting alternatives, voting      system reforms and the use of proxy advisory firms in      connection therewith. In addition, the Proponent&rsquo;s Web      site is false and misleading by providing a link to an      article entitled &quot;SEC Clarifies Position on Auditor      Independence Resolution.&quot; The author of the article      asserts that the Staffs position regarding stockholder      proposals that seek to prohibit auditing firms from providing      non-audit services, as discussed and distinguished above,      implicates a change in the Staff&rsquo;s position regarding      proposals similar to the Proponent&rsquo;s in <u>SONICblue</u> and thus the Proposal at issue. In addition, the      Proponent&rsquo;s Web site discusses his &quot;Pre-IPO&quot;      initiative for the start of new companies and. further      provides several personal links, including his resume,      commercial interests and his &quot;personal home page.&quot;      Again, none of the additional information provided at the      Proponent&rsquo;s Web site is relevant to the subject matter      of the Proposal. Instead, the information provided at the      Proponent&rsquo;s Web site is, at best, only topically related      to auditors, generally, but substantively irrelevant to the      matter of the selection of auditors by stockholders, and      reference to the Web site as a source of information on the      Proposal is thereby more likely to confuse and mislead      stockholders who view the Web site. Reference to the      Proponent&rsquo;s Web site in general, and specifically as a      source for additional information on the Proposal,      contravenes the proxy rules by being materially false and      misleading as to the subject matter of, and reasons      supporting, the Proposal. Finally, because the      Proponent&rsquo;s Web site is subject to change at his whim,      the information provided at the Web site could be altered in      the future (as has been done in recent weeks) to present      additional and different information while his Proposal is      under consideration by Company stockholders, thus enabling      the Proponent to further expand the scope of the Proposal and      its supporting statement.</p>
		      <p>We respectfully submit that      because the Proponent&rsquo;s Web site includes and discusses      information that is irrelevant to the subject matter of the      Proposal, is likely to confuse stockholders and is subject to      change by the Proponent, reference to it in the Proposal      violates Rule 14a-9&rsquo;s prohibition against false and      misleading statements in proxy soliciting materials. For      these reasons reference to the Web site should be excluded      from the Proposal in any event.</p>
		      <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
		      <p>Based on the foregoing, we      respectfully request that the Staff confirm that it will not      recommend enforcement action if the Proposal is omitted from      Fleetwood&rsquo;s 2002 Proxy Materials. Should you disagree      with the conclusions set forth herein, we would appreciate      the opportunity to confer with you before the issuance of      your response.
