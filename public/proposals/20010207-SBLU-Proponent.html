		      <p>Re: <strong><u>Shareowner Proposal of Mark Latham to SONICblue</u></strong></p>
		      <p>Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>
		      <p>I am writing in response to the January 25, 2001 letter      (the &quot;SONICblue Letter&quot;) submitted to the      Commission by Ms. Mary Helvey on behalf of SONICblue      Incorporated (&quot;SONICblue&quot; or the      &quot;Company&quot;), which expresses the Company&rsquo;s      intention to omit from its proxy statement for the 2001      annual meeting a shareowner proposal (the      &quot;Proposal&quot; or &quot;my Proposal&quot;) submitted by      me. The Proposal (attached) would request the Company&rsquo;s      Board of Directors to have the Company&rsquo;s auditor      selected annually by shareowner vote.</p>
		      <p>The SONICblue Letter cites Rules 14a-8(i)(7)      (&lsquo;ordinary business&rsquo;), 14a-8(i)(1) (&lsquo;improper      under state law&rsquo;), 14a-8(i)(3) (&lsquo;false and      misleading&rsquo;), and 14a-8(i)(10) (&lsquo;substantially      implemented&rsquo;) as bases for its request for relief from      enforcement action. Reasons are given below why I believe the      Proposal may not be properly omitted under Rule 14a-8.</p>
		      <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Rule 14a-8(i)(7) -- &lsquo;ordinary business&rsquo;</u></strong></p>
		      <p>The Commission has recently recognized that auditor      selection is not merely an ordinary business matter. <em>Revision      of the Commission&rsquo;s Auditor Independence Requirements</em> (File No. S7-13-00, released November 21, 2000) cites      advancing technology and broadening participation in security      markets, noting that &quot;[t]hese and other market changes      highlight the importance to the market and to investor      confidence of financial information that has been audited by      an auditor whose only master is the investing public.&quot;      Further, &quot;&hellip;the accounting industry has been      transformed by significant changes in the structure of the      largest firms.&quot;</p>
		      <p>This new Auditor Independence Rule recognizes that auditor      selection should not be left entirely to the discretion of      each company&rsquo;s management -- in other words, that it is      not just an ordinary business decision. Instead, auditor      selection involves an agency conflict between managers and      shareowners. Because auditors perform a monitoring function,      managers naturally prefer to choose auditors that monitor      them less strictly, while shareowners would prefer stricter      monitoring. Manager-shareowner agency conflicts are at the      heart of most corporate governance controversies, such as      poison pill ratification and staggered board elections. Such      matters are frequently addressed by shareowner proposals.</p>
		      <p>The Commission limits auditor selection by requiring      managers to choose auditors that satisfy the      Commission&rsquo;s definition of independence. This helps      protect shareowners&rsquo; interests. If auditor selection      were merely an ordinary business decision, surely the      Commission would not be getting involved in it.</p>
		      <p>Shareowners can also help protect their own interests. By      voting to choose the auditor, they can create a competitive      market for auditor reputation. This may turn out to be a more      flexible and powerful force for auditor independence than the      Commission&rsquo;s Auditor Independence Rule. The Commission      is doubtless aware of the difficulty and controversy of      defining independence in terms of written verifiable      standards.</p>
		      <p>Rule 14a-8(i) is part of a tradeoff between enabling      shareowners to have a voice in appropriate ways on the one      hand, and excluding counterproductive uses of the proposal      mechanism on the other. Rule 14a-8(i)(7), the &lsquo;ordinary      business&rsquo; exclusion, is more specifically about the      tradeoff between shareowner voice and excess micro-management      of decisions better left to management. The Commission has      clearly determined that auditor selection should not just be      left to management. But is it practical for shareowners to      get involved? As the Proposal&rsquo;s supporting statement      points out:</p>
		      <blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>&quot;Investors could              decide how important auditor independence is to them,              and how it should be assessed.</p>
                  <p>The average investor              may seem ill-equipped to make such assessments on her              own. But she would not make them on her own. She              would benefit from consensus-building discussion by              the entire investment community, including proxy              advisory firms. It is much easier to assess              reputations of auditors than of board members,              because there are only a handful of auditing firms,              versus hundreds of board candidates for a diversified              portfolio of stocks over the years.&quot;</p>

                  <strong><u>Rule 14a-8(i)(1) -- &lsquo;improper under state      law&rsquo;</u></strong></p>
		      <p>The SONICblue Letter claims (page 2): &quot;The Proposal      mandates that the stockholders annually select the      Company&rsquo;s independent auditors.&quot; This is false and      misleading. The Proposal does not mandate anything.</p>
		      <p>Because it is precatory, the Proposal mandates no board      action, and removes no authority from SONICblue&rsquo;s Board      of Directors. The subject of the Proposal is a request for      action by the Board. The Proposal leaves open to      SONICblue&rsquo;s Board several courses of action, none of      which would contravene Delaware state law:</p>
		      <blockquote>
                <p>1. Do nothing.</p>
		        <p>2. To the extent permissible under Delaware state law          and SONICblue&rsquo;s bylaws and certificate of          incorporation, implement the Board&rsquo;s interpretation          of the shareowners&rsquo; request.</p>
		        <p>3. Amend SONICblue&rsquo;s bylaws and certificate of          incorporation, if necessary with the approval of          shareowners, to permit further implementation of the          Proposal. Note that section 141(a) of the Delaware          General Corporation Law, as quoted in the SONICblue          Letter (page 4), specifically permits each corporation to          specify, in its certificate of incorporation, the          authority of its Board of Directors.</p>
	          </blockquote>
		      <p>For a proposal to <em>Washington Mutual</em> (February 22,      2000) that would let shareowners choose independent agents      for the company to hire, SEC staff deemed that it would not      be excludable under rule 14a-8(i)(1) if it is worded as a      request. The current Proposal is worded as a request.</p>
		      <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Rules 14a-8(i)(3) (&lsquo;false and misleading&rsquo;)</u></strong></p>
		      <p>The SONICblue Letter claims that the Proposal is vague and      indefinite, frequently comparing it with a proposal to <em>Connecticut      Natural Gas Corporation</em> (November 29, 1993) (the      &quot;CNGC Proposal&quot;). Although the subject matter is      similar, in terms of vagueness these two proposals are as      different as night and day. Here is the entire text of the      CNGC Proposal:</p>
		      <blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>&quot;I am formally              requesting the following proposal be included on the              proxy statement:</p>
                  <p>FROM: Proposal to              approve the appointment of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.              as auditors for the fiscal year. . .</p>
                  <p>TO: Proposal to              approve the appointment of one of the following              public accounting firms (choice of three) as auditors              for the fiscal year.</p>
                  <p>&dagger;&dagger;&dagger;&dagger;&dagger;              Option One or</p>
                  <p>&dagger;&dagger;&dagger;&dagger;&dagger;              Option Two or</p>
                  <p>&dagger;&dagger;&dagger;&dagger;&dagger;              Option Three&quot;</p>
                </blockquote>
	          </blockquote>
		      <p>As Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation&rsquo;s counsel      pointed out: &quot;The Proposal does not set forth any      proposed resolution for adoption by shareholders. It does not      contain any supporting statement, nor does it request that      any supporting statement be included in the Company's proxy      materials. It simply requests that the quoted text be      included in the Company's proxy statement distributed in      connection with the 1994 Annual Meeting.&quot;</p>
		      <p>By contrast, my Proposal sets forth a proposed resolution      for adoption by shareholders, and contains a supporting      statement.</p>
		      <p>Understandably, the Commission did not object to exclusion      of the CNGC Proposal, responding: &quot;There appears to be      some basis for your view that the proposal may be omitted      from the proxy materials in reliance on rule 14a-8(c)(3)      because the submission is vague and indefinite.&quot;      However, the SONICblue Letter&rsquo;s claim that &quot;the      Staff did not recommend enforcement action&hellip;because the      proposal was ambiguous <u>as to the criteria for selection of      the auditors, the voting process by which the auditors should      be chosen, and the effect the proposal would have on the      board as a result of an affirmative vote</u>&quot; has no      basis in the Staff letter for the words I have underlined.</p>
		      <p>Regarding the SONICblue Letter&rsquo;s specific objections      to my Proposal: Because it is precatory, my Proposal allows      the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors discretion in      implementing it. Applicable laws and rules must be obeyed,      including Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(d) and the new SEC      Auditor Independence Rule. Thus the Board can determine which      accounting firms are qualified, but are requested not to      limit shareowner choice beyond that.</p>
		      <p>The SONICblue Letter is right to point out that the      balloting rules are important and must be determined. The      Board is capable of specifying them appropriately. For      example, a well known and effective way of determining a      majority winner when there are multiple candidates is to let      each voter rank the candidates, indicating first, second,      third choice and so on.</p>
		      <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Rule 14a-8(i)(10) -- &lsquo;substantially      implemented&rsquo;</u></strong></p>
		      <p>There is a substantial difference between an election with      only one candidate and an election with multiple candidates.      So the Proposal has not been substantially implemented.</p>
		      <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
		      <p>Based on the foregoing, I respectfully request that the      Commission staff find that SONICblue lacks sufficient grounds      for excluding the Proposal from its proxy statement. Please      call me at (415) 391-7198, or e-mail me at      mlatham@corpmon.com, with any questions about this      submission.</p>
