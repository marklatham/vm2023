		    <h3><strong>KB HOME BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION ON  THE</strong><strong> PROXY ADVISOR PROPOSAL </strong><strong></strong><strong>IN 2001  PROXY</strong> STATEMENT </h3>
		    <blockquote>
              <hr />
              <p>RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS      AGAINST THE PROPOSAL</p>
		      <p>Your Board of Directors recommends that you      vote AGAINST the stockholder proposal for the following      reasons:</p>
		      <ol>
                <li>The Board of Directors, which includes              eight outside directors and only two members of              management, is in the best position to make informed              recommendations to the Company's stockholders with              respect to the matters voted upon.</li>
		        <li>There already is a significant amount              of research and information readily available on the              Internet and elsewhere regarding the Company and              issues important to the Company's stockholders.</li>
		        <li>The stockholder proposal would require              the Company to spend corporate funds for the hiring              of a proxy advisory firm and for the distribution of              the firm's advice to stockholders.</li>
		        <li>The stockholder proposal would              preclude management of the Company from evaluating              the quality of the proxy advisory firm's work, its              recommendations or the process by which              recommendations are made.</li>
	          </ol>
		      <p>ACCORDINGLY, YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE      &quot;AGAINST&quot; THIS PROPOSAL</p>
		      <hr />
            </blockquote>
		    <p><strong>PROPONENT'S RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE:</strong></p>
		    <p>1. The independent advisor's recommendation would add to, not  replace, the Board's recommendation on which way to vote. So KB  Home shareowners could benefit from both sources of advice.</p>
		    <p>2. While large amounts of information are available on the  Internet, they are not conveniently summarized into an  independent recommendation on how to vote specific proxy issues,  which the proposal would provide.</p>
		    <p>3. While the proposal would involve spending corporate funds,  the costs are very small relative to the potential benefits of  more informed voting. Also, many of KB Home's institutional  shareowners are already paying for proxy advice, and those fees  are likely to decline if this proposal spreads to many companies.</p>
		    <p>4. We agree with the Board's implication that the quality of  the advisory firm is crucial, but not with the implication that  supervision by the Board is necessary to assure that quality.  Gillette shareowners would vote to choose the advisory firm based  on its reputation in their eyes. Advisors would compete to build  reputations for giving advice that benefits shareowners. Those  reputations would be assessed and discussed by the financial  community in much the same way that personal computer makers'  reputations are determined in the technology community, so that  even a non-expert could make an informed choice by reading, for  example, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>.</p>
