		      <p>Re: <strong><u>Shareowner Proposal of Mark Latham to Citigroup</u></strong></p>
		      <p>Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>
		      <p>I am writing in response to the January 24, 2000 letter      (the &quot;2nd Citigroup Letter&quot;) submitted      to the Commission by Citigroup Inc. (&quot;Citigroup&quot; or      the &quot;Company&quot;).</p>
		      <p>I submit that my January 10 letter was responsive to the      arguments for omission presented in Citigroup&rsquo;s petition      of December 22, 1999. Some of my responses are reiterated      below. The revisions I suggested for maintaining precatory      language were not in direct response to concerns raised in      the Citigroup petition, but provide a clarification that may      be legally significant and thus worthwhile. The January 10      &quot;Revised Proposal&quot; is attached.</p>
		      <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Rule 14a-8(i)(7) -- &lsquo;ordinary business&rsquo;</u></strong></p>
		      <p>The Citigroup petition contends that the Revised Proposal      may be omitted under Rule 14a-8(i)(7) because it &quot;would      infringe upon management&rsquo;s decision-making functions      concerning &hellip; retention of consultants.&quot; My response      is that while most hiring of consultants is indeed ordinary      business, the hiring of a proxy advisor for shareowner voting      is not; hence the relevance of my emphasizing that the      Revised Proposal &quot;would not restrict the Company from      hiring any other external consultants.&quot;</p>
		      <p>I concur that &quot;the Proxy Statement is not the      appropriate forum for a <em>Consumer Reports</em> guide to      proxy advisory firms&quot;. <em>Consumer Reports</em> has an      enviable reputation for the independence of its      recommendations; management does not. As for providing      shareowners &quot;sufficient material to make an informed      decision&quot;, consider the information proxy statements      typically provide about director candidates. While it may be      accurate, it is not sufficient for discerning a      candidate&rsquo;s effectiveness and degree of loyalty to      shareowner interests. That is why shareowner voting on      directors remains a mere formality in all but a few cases. By      contrast, shareowners could become informed about proxy      advisor reputations, because there would be fewer of them      nationwide than director candidates. Advisor reputations      would not be determined solely (or even primarily) in proxy      statements, but rather in independent business media. But      once shareowners have chosen a proxy advisor, the voting      advice it provides on other proxy matters will have the      independence that management&rsquo;s advice lacks.</p>
		      <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Rule 14a-8(i)(4) -- &lsquo;personal interest&rsquo;</u></strong></p>
		      <p>References in the supporting statement to websites and      published articles are of substantial benefit to Citigroup      shareowners seeking further information to help them weigh      the pros and cons of the Revised Proposal. This provides an      important response to concerns raised in the Rule 14a-8(i)(3)      section of the 2nd Citigroup Letter, regarding      purported ambiguities and lack of clarity. Like the rest of      the Revised Proposal, inclusion of these references is      designed entirely for the benefit of Citigroup shareowners.</p>
		      <p>Nonetheless, if the Commission staff deems it necessary      that I omit any or all website references from the Revised      Proposal in order to have it included with the proxy      materials, I would be willing to do so.</p>
		      <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Rule 14a-8(i)(3) -- &lsquo;false and misleading&rsquo;</u></strong></p>
		      <p>I believe that my January 10 letter&rsquo;s description of      how shareowners could learn about proxy advisors&rsquo;      reputations is sufficient and logical. Within the 500-word      limit, the Revised Proposal makes several important      references relating to this: </p>
		      <blockquote>
                <p>1. &quot;WHEREAS proxy advisory firms have established          reputations for giving sound independent advice to many          institutional investors on how to vote their          shares;&quot;</p>
		        <p>2. website addresses for the three leading American          proxy advisory firms;</p>
		        <p>3. <em>Wall Street Journal</em> articles about proxy          advisory firms; and</p>
		        <p>4. research articles in business journals, which          discuss these matters in more detail.</p>
	          </blockquote>
		      <p>If the Commission staff nonetheless considers any part of      the Revised Proposal to be false or misleading, I would be      willing to delete such part.</p>
		      <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
		      <p>Based on the foregoing, I respectfully request that the      Commission staff find that Citigroup lacks sufficient grounds      for excluding the Revised Proposal from its proxy statement.      Please call me at (415) 391-7198, or e-mail me at      mlatham@corpmon.com, with any questions about this      submission.</p>
		      <p>Please acknowledge receipt of this submission by      date-stamping and returning the enclosed photocopy of this      letter to me in the enclosed stamped, self-addressed      envelope.</p>
		      <p>Very truly yours,</p>
