		    <p><em>Shareowner proposal submitted to KB Home on October 23, 2000:</em></p>
		    <hr />
		    <h3><strong>HIRE PROXY ADVISORY FIRM CHOSEN BY  SHAREOWNER VOTE</strong></h3>
		    <blockquote>
              <p>WHEREAS many shareowners lack the time and      expertise to make the best voting decisions, yet prefer not      to always follow management&rsquo;s recommendations, because      of management&rsquo;s possible conflicts of interest;</p>
		      <p>WHEREAS shareowners have a common interest      in obtaining sound independent advice, but often insufficient      private interest to justify paying for it individually (the      &quot;free-rider&quot; problem);</p>
		      <p>THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that KB Home      shareowners request the Board of Directors to hire a proxy      advisory firm for one year, to be chosen by shareowner vote.      Shareowners request the Board to take all necessary steps to      enact this resolution in time to hold the vote at the      year-2002 shareowner meeting, with the following features:</p>
		      <blockquote>
                <ul>
                  <li>To insulate advisor selection                      from influence by Company management, any                      proxy advisory firm could put itself on the                      ballot by paying an entry fee, declaring the                      price (no more than $5000) for advisory                      services for the coming year, and providing                      the address of a website describing their                      proposed services and qualifications.</li>
                  <li>The winning candidate would be                      paid its declared price by the Company, and                      make advice freely available to all Company                      shareowners for the subsequent year, on all                      matters put to shareowner vote except                      director elections. This advice could relate                      to such matters as mergers, stock option                      plans, and shareowner proposals. (Advice on                      director elections is excluded to satisfy SEC                      rule 14a-8(i)(8).)</li>
                  <li>Performance of the advisory                      firm would not be policed by Company                      management, but rather by gain or loss of the                      advisor&rsquo;s reputation and future                      business.</li>
                  <li>Brief summary advice could be                      included in the Company proxy, with                      references to a website and/or a toll-free                      phone number for more detail.</li>
                  <li>The decision of whether to                      hire proxy advisory firms in later years                      would be left open, and could be decided by                      future shareowner votes.</li>
                </ul>
		      </blockquote>
		      <p><u>Supporting Statement:</u></p>
		      <p>This proposal can be expected to improve      the Company&rsquo;s stock return by:</p>
		      <blockquote>
                <ul>
                  <li>improving management                      accountability to shareowners by making                      independent professionally researched advice                      available to all;</li>
                  <li>increasing support for                      value-enhancing mergers and proposals;</li>
                  <li>encouraging greater                      competition on price and quality among proxy                      advisors to serve shareowner interests,                      making it easier for new advisors to enter                      the business, and reducing the market share                      of the largest proxy advisory firm.</li>
                </ul>
		      </blockquote>
		      <p>Like the Company&rsquo;s external auditor,      the proxy advisor would be paid with Company funds to give      shareowners an independent professional opinion. Independence      would be further enhanced by having shareowners choose the      proxy advisor.</p>
		      <p>The conflicts of interest betwen managers      and shareowners are described in Monks and Minow&rsquo;s 1996      book <em>Watching the Watchers</em>, along with      shareowners&rsquo; information problems.</p>
		      <p>Articles discussing the company-pay system      for proxy advice are on the Corporate Monitoring website (<a href="http://www.corpmon.com/publications.htm">http://www.corpmon.com/publications.htm</a>), in particular &quot;The Internet Will Drive      Corporate Monitoring&quot; (<em>Corporate Governance      International</em>, June 2000). Further developments in      corporate governance that may follow from this proposal are      presented in &quot;The Corporate Monitoring Firm&quot; (<em>Corporate      Governance: An International Review</em>, January 1999) and      &quot;Corporate Monitoring: New Shareholder Power Tool&quot;      (<em>Financial Analysts Journal</em>, September/October 1998).</p>
