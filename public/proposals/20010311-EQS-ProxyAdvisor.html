		    <p><em>Shareowner proposal revision submitted to Equus II on March 11, 2001:</em></p>
		    <hr />
		    <h3><strong>HIRE PROXY ADVISORY FIRM CHOSEN BY  SHAREOWNER VOTE</strong></h3>
		    <blockquote>
              <p>WHEREAS Equus II currently trades at a relatively deep      discount to net asset value;</p>
		      <p align="left">WHEREAS many shareowners lack the time and expertise to      make intelligent voting decisions, yet recognize      management&rsquo;s recommendations may be tainted by conflicts      of interest;</p>
		      <p>WHEREAS proxy advisory firms have established reputations      for sound independent advice, with their recommendations      sometimes dramatically increasing institutional votes in      opposition to management; </p>
		      <p>WHEREAS shareowners have a common interest in obtaining      sound independent advice, but often insufficient private      interest to justify paying for it individually (the      &quot;free-rider&quot; problem);</p>
		      <p>THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Equus II shareowners request      the Board of Directors to hire a proxy advisory firm, chosen      by shareowner vote. Shareowners request the Board to enact      this resolution in time to hold the vote at the year-2002      shareowner meeting, with the following features:</p>
		      <ul>
                <li>To insulate selection from Company management              influence, any proxy advisory firm could put itself              on the proxy by:
                    <blockquote>
                      <ul>
                        <li>paying an entry fee, </li>
                        <li>declaring the price ($5000 limit) for                          advisory services for the coming year,                          and </li>
                        <li>providing the address of a website                          describing their proposed services and                          qualifications.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </blockquote>
                </li>
		        <li>The winning advisor would be paid its declared price              by the Company, and would make advice freely              available to all Company shareowners for the              subsequent year on all matters put to shareowner              vote, except director elections (excluded to satisfy              SEC rule 14a-8(i)(8)).</li>
		        <li>Advice could relate to such matters as open-ending or              liquidation, mergers, stock option plans, and              shareowner proposals. </li>
		        <li>Summary advice could be included in the Company              proxy, with references to a website and/or a              toll-free phone number for more detail.</li>
		        <li>Performance of the advisory firm would not be policed              by Company management, but rather by gain or loss of              the advisor&rsquo;s reputation with shareholders.</li>
		        <li>The decision of whether to hire proxy advisory firms              in later years would be decided by future shareowner              votes.</li>
	          </ul>
		      <p><u>Supporting Statement:</u></p>
		      <p>Like the Company&rsquo;s external auditor, the proxy      advisor should be paid with Company funds, giving shareowners      an independent professional opinion. Independence is further      enhanced when shareowners choose the advisor.</p>
		      <p>The conflicts of interest betwen managers and shareowners      are described in Robert Monks and Nell Minow&rsquo;s 1996 book <em>Watching the Watchers</em>, along with shareowners&rsquo;      &quot;free rider&quot; and &quot;rational ignorance&quot;      problems.<a href="http://www.corpmon.com/ProxyAdvisorFAQ.htm">Proxy Advisor Proposal FAQ</a></p>
		      <p>Proxy advisory firms such as Proxy Monitor (<a href="http://www.proxymonitor.com">http://www.proxymonitor.com</a>),      Institutional Shareholder Services (<a href="http://iss.cda.com">http://iss.cda.com</a>), and      Investor Responsibility Research Center (<a href="http://www.irrc.org">http://www.irrc.org</a>) are      frequently cited in the financial press. Examples are      &quot;Venator Holders Are Urged To Support Dissident      Slate&quot; (<em>Wall Street Journal</em> 07/06/1999) and      &quot;ISS's Influence Grows In Proxy, Option Matters&quot; (<em>Wall      Street Journal</em> 11/10/1997).</p>
		      <p>Articles discussing the company-pay system for proxy      advice and developments that may follow are on the Corporate      Monitoring website (<a href="http://www.corpmon.com/publications.htm">http://www.corpmon.com/publications.htm</a>).      General background materials on corporate governance can be      found at Corporate Governance (<a href="http://www.corpgov.net">http://www.corpgov.net</a>) and      The Corporate Library (<a href="http://www.thecorporatelibrary.com">http://www.thecorporatelibrary.com</a>).</p>
