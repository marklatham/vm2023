		    <p><em>Shareowner proposal revision submitted to Pfizer on January 10, 2000:</em></p>
		    <hr />
		    <h3><strong>HIRE PROXY ADVISORY FIRM CHOSEN BY  SHAREOWNER VOTE</strong></h3>
		    <blockquote>
              <p>WHEREAS shareowners often lack the time and expertise to      make the best voting decisions, yet prefer not to follow      management&rsquo;s recommendations blindly because <br />
                of possible conflicts of interest;</p>
		      <p>WHEREAS proxy advisory firms have established reputations      for providing sound independent analysis to investors on      proxy issues;</p>
		      <p>WHEREAS shareowners have a common interest in obtaining      independent analysis, but often insufficient private interest      to justify paying for it individually (the      &quot;free-rider&quot; problem);</p>
		      <p>THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Pfizer shareowners request      the Board of Directors to hire a proxy advisory firm for one      year, to be chosen by shareowner vote. Shareowners request      the Board to take all necessary steps to enact this      resolution in time to hold the vote at the year 2001      shareowner meeting, with the following features:</p>
		      <blockquote>
                <p>Any proxy advisory firm could put itself on the ballot          by paying a minimal processing fee to Pfizer ($100 is          suggested) and declaring the price of its services for          the coming year, not to exceed $10,000.</p>
		        <p>The proxy advisory firm receiving the highest vote          would be to be paid by Pfizer and expected to make its          proxy analysis on Pfizer freely available for the year          2002 meeting.</p>
		        <p>The proxy advisory's analysis would be included with          Pfizer's proxy materials for the year 2002 meeting or be          otherwise widely distributed.</p>
		        <p>The quality of services rendered would not be policed          by Pfizer, but rather by loss or gain of reputation by          the proxy advisory firm.</p>
	          </blockquote>
		      <p><u>Supporting Statement:</u></p>
		      <p>This proposal is designed to:</p>
		      <blockquote>
                <p>enhance management accountability and good corporate          governance by making professionally researched analysis          available to all;</p>
		        <p>enfranchise investors by providing analysis of proxy          issues, independent of management&rsquo;s recommendations;</p>
		        <p>reduce the overall cost to shareowners of voting          analysis through competitive bid and collective purchase;</p>
		        <p>encourage greater competition among proxy advisory          firms to serve shareowner interests;</p>
		        <p>stimulate shareholders to submit shareholder          resolutions or take other initiatives, knowing that          independent analysis may prompt support if the proxy          monitoring analysis appears favorable;</p>
		        <p>increase the likelihood that shareowners add to          Pfizer's knowledge base and its ability to generate          wealth.</p>

		      <p>Proxy advisory firms such as Institutional Shareholder      Services (<a href="http://iss.cda.com">http://iss.cda.com</a>),      Investor Responsibility Research Center (<a href="http://www.irrc.org">http://www.irrc.org</a>) and Proxy      Monitor (http://www.proxymonitor.com)      are frequently cited in the financial press. See      &quot;Venator Holders Are Urged To Support Dissident      Slate&quot; (<em>Wall Street Journal</em> 07/06/1999) and      &quot;ISS's Influence Grows In Proxy, Option Matters&quot; (<em>Wall      Street Journal</em> 11/10/1997).</p>
		      <p>Articles discussing the company-pay system for proxy      advice are on the Corporate Monitoring website      (http://www.corpmon.com/publications.htm). These include      &quot;Collective Action for Dispersed Shareowners&quot; (<em>Corporate      Governance International</em>, September 1999) and &quot;The      Internet Will Drive Corporate Monitoring&quot;. Possible      future developments are presented in &quot;The Corporate      Monitoring Firm&quot; (<em>Corporate Governance: An      International Review</em>, January 1999) and &quot;Corporate      Monitoring: New Shareholder Power Tool&quot; (<em>Financial      Analysts Journal</em>, September/October 1998).</p>
