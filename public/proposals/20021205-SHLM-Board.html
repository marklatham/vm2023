                  <p><strong>STATEMENT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDING A VOTE AGAINST THE       STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL </strong></p>
                  <p>The Board of Directors recommends a vote &ldquo;Against&rdquo; the proposal. The       Board firmly believes that the implementation of the proposal described       above would not be in the best interests of the Corporation or you, our       Stockholders. </p>
                  <p>The Board consists of ten Directors, seven whom are &ldquo;outside directors&rdquo;       not otherwise employed by the Corporation and three whom are members of       management. The Corporation&rsquo;s Directors are experienced individuals who are       familiar with the Corporation&rsquo;s business and the markets in which the       Corporation operates. Each Director brings his or her unique business       experience to the Corporation. Each Director, working together and with       management and well-qualified outside consultants, thoroughly and regularly       evaluates the Corporation&rsquo;s strategies for maximizing Stockholder value and       makes recommendations to management, and ultimately you, our Stockholders,       based upon such evaluations. The Board of Directors believes it is in the       best position to make informed recommendations to the Corporation&rsquo;s       Stockholders in respect of matters to be voted upon. Adding<a href="http://www.votermedia.org/corporations/20021205-SHLM-Board.html#1"><strong>1</strong></a> the advice of an outside, unsupervised and possibly       randomly selected<a href="http://www.votermedia.org/corporations/20021205-SHLM-Board.html#2"><strong>2</strong></a> firm (at the Corporation&rsquo;s expense)       would not assist the Board in furthering the Corporation&rsquo;s objectives or       otherwise be in the Stockholder&rsquo;s best interests. </p>
                  <p>The proposal described above calls for the Corporation to hire a proxy       advisory firm without screening or review of the quality of the firm<a href="http://www.votermedia.org/corporations/20021205-SHLM-Board.html#3"><strong>3</strong></a> or its work product       or without any due diligence as to its general or industry-specific business       experience. The Board of Directors and management, on the other hand, select       the Corporation&rsquo;s advisors, including its independent auditors, based on a       thorough review process. The Board of Directors does not believe it is in       the best interests of our Stockholders for the Corporation to spend funds to       hire a proxy advisory firm without first evaluating the need for such advice<a href="http://www.votermedia.org/corporations/20021205-SHLM-Board.html#4"><strong>4</strong></a> and the quality of the firm&rsquo;s work, its recommendations and the process by       which such recommendations are made. </p>
                  <p>The Board of Directors is committed to providing you, our Stockholders,       with useful voting recommendations and high quality information on which to       base your voting decisions. The Board of Directors takes its responsibility       seriously and its only agenda is furthering the interests of the Corporation       and its Stockholders. The Board of Directors does not believe that the       Corporation should provide an open forum in our proxy materials<a href="http://www.votermedia.org/corporations/20021205-SHLM-Board.html#5"><strong>5</strong></a> for an unknown and unsupervised proxy advisory firm at our Stockholder&rsquo;s       ultimate expense. The Board of Directors believes that you, our       Stockholders, should allow the Board of Directors to continue to perform its       duties by providing sound and well-reasoned recommendations for this       Corporation&rsquo;s future courses of action.<a href="http://www.votermedia.org/corporations/20021205-SHLM-Board.html#6"><strong>6</strong></a> </p>
                  <p><strong>REQUIRED VOTE </strong></p>
                  <p>The approval of Mr. Latham&rsquo;s proposal requires the affirmative vote of a       majority of the shares of Common Stock of the Corporation represented at the       meeting in person or by proxy. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have       the same effect as a vote cast against the proposal.<a href="http://www.votermedia.org/corporations/20021205-SHLM-Board.html#7"><strong>7</strong></a> </p>
                  <p><strong>THEREFORE, FOR ALL OF THE REASONS STATED ABOVE, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS       URGES STOCKHOLDERS TO VOTE &ldquo;AGAINST&rdquo; THIS PROPOSAL.</strong></p>
                <hr />
              </blockquote>
                <p><strong>PROPONENT'S RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE:</strong></p>
                <p><a name="1" id="1"><strong>1</strong></a><strong>.</strong> As the  Board mentions here, the independent advisor's recommendation  would <em><strong>add to</strong></em>, rather than replace, the  Board's recommendation on which way to vote. So  shareowners could benefit from both sources of advice.</p>
                <p><a name="2" id="2"><strong>2</strong></a><strong>. </strong>The advisor would be   selected by shareowner vote, based on the reputations of competing advisor   candidates -- not a random selection process.</p>
                <p><a name="3" id="3"><strong>3</strong></a><strong>.</strong> I agree with  the Board's implication that the quality of the advisory firm is  crucial, but not with the implication that supervision by the  Board is necessary to assure that quality. Shareowners  would vote to choose the advisory firm based on its reputation in  their eyes. Advisors would compete to build reputations for  giving advice that benefits shareowners. Those reputations would  be assessed and discussed by the financial community in much the  same way that personal computer makers' reputations are  determined in the technology community, so that even a non-expert  could make an informed choice by reading, for example, the <em>Wall  Street Journal</em>. This reputation assessment process is a review of the   quality of the advisory firm.</p>
                <p><a name="4" id="4"><strong>4</strong></a><strong>.</strong> We shareowners need   independent voting advice for the same reason we need to have shareowner voting   at all.&nbsp; If it were sufficient to simply vote following the Board's   recommendations then we wouldn't need to vote, but instead could just leave all   decisions to the Board. The reason why we have shareowner voting is that there   would be conflicts of interest inherent in leaving all decisions to the Board.</p>
                <p><a name="5" id="5"><strong>5</strong></a><strong>.</strong> I agree that Schulman's   proxy should not be an open forum. That is why the proposal calls for an entry   fee, which can be adjusted to deter all but the serious candidates.</p>
                <p><a name="6" id="6"><strong>6</strong></a><strong>.</strong> As emphasized in point 1 above, this proposal would   not prevent the Board from continuing to give recommendations.</p>
                <p><a name="7" id="7"><strong>7</strong></a><strong>.</strong> This  is a well-placed reminder of a voting system biased against shareowners'   interests and in favor of the incumbent Board's interests.&nbsp; My proposal   would help shareowners vote more effectively, thus reducing such bias.</p>
