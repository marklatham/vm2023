                  <p align="center">CORPORATION'S RESPONSE<strong><a href="20040429-OS-Board.html#1">1</a></strong> TO STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL </p>
                  <p>The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST approval of the       Stockholder Proposal as the implementation of the proposal described above       would not be in the best interests of the Corporation or you, our       stockholders.<strong><a href="20040429-OS-Board.html#2">2</a></strong> In the opinion of the       Board of Directors: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The Board consists of eight Directors, seven of whom are &quot;independent         directors&quot; and one is a member of management. The directors are         experienced individuals who are familiar with the Corporation's business         and the markets in which the Corporation operates. The Board of Directors         believes it is sufficiently independent of management to avoid conflicts         of interest. Adding<strong><a href="20040429-OS-Board.html#3">3</a></strong> the advice of an         outside firm (at the Corporation's expense) would not assist the Board or         stockholders in furthering the Corporation's objectives or otherwise be in         the stockholder's best interests.<br />
                      &nbsp;</li>
                    <li>The Board of Directors is committed to providing Corporation         stockholders with useful voting recommendations and information on which         to make voting decisions. The Board bases its recommendations on its         knowledge of the Corporation, its strategic plans for the business and         input from management and outside advisers. We do not believe adding the         advice of an unsupervised<strong><a href="20040429-OS-Board.html#4">4</a></strong> firm at our         expense would be in the interests of our stockholders. <br />
                      &nbsp;</li>
                    <li>This proposal calls for the Corporation to hire a proxy advisory firm         without screening, input or review by the Board or management of the         quality of the firm or its work product. Even our independent auditors are         selected and reviewed by the Audit Committee. The Board of Directors does         not believe it is in the best interests of our stockholders to spend funds         to hire a proxy advisory firm without first evaluating the need for such         advice<strong><a href="20040429-OS-Board.html#5">5</a></strong> and the quality of the firm's         work<strong><a href="20040429-OS-Board.html#6">6</a></strong>, its recommendations and the         process by which such recommendations are made. <br />
                      &nbsp;</li>
                    <li>The proposal calls for the firm to be paid without regard to the         reasonableness of this compensation for the work performed.<strong><a href="20040429-OS-Board.html#7">7</a></strong> While the proposal purports to cap the fees paid to the elected proxy         advisory firms, we believe the actual costs of the proposal will be         greater. We do not believe it is a good idea for us to abdicate our         responsibilities to evaluate the engagement, services and compensation of         outside advisers<strong><a href="20040429-OS-Board.html#8">8</a></strong>, and do not believe         we should provide an open forum in our proxy materials<strong><a href="20040429-OS-Board.html#9">9</a></strong> for an unknown and unsupervised firm.<strong><a href="20040429-OS-Board.html#10">10</a></strong> <br />
                      &nbsp;</li>
                    <li>The Stockholder Proposal involves additional cost to the proxy         process.<strong><a href="20040429-OS-Board.html#11">11</a></strong> <br />
                      &nbsp;</li>
                    <li>There is a significant volume of published research and other         literature regarding the Corporation and issues of importance to the         Corporation's stockholders (made even more accessible by the Internet),         and a proxy advisory firm would offer little marginal benefit in         communicating with stockholders.<strong><a href="20040429-OS-Board.html#12">12</a></strong> </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>THEREFORE, FOR ALL OF THE REASONS STATED ABOVE, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS       URGES STOCKHOLDERS TO VOTE &quot;AGAINST&quot; THIS PROPOSAL 2. </p>
                  <p align="center">REQUIRED VOTE </p>
                  <p>The affirmative vote of the majority of the shares present in person or       represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the stockholder       proposal is required to approve the stockholder proposal, which is framed as       a &quot;recommendation&quot; to the Board. An abstention is treated as being present       and entitled to vote on the matter and, therefore, has the effect of a vote       against the stockholder proposal.<strong><a href="http://www.corpmon.com/OS-debate.htm#13">13</a></strong> A       broker &quot;non-vote&quot; is treated as not being entitled to vote on the matter       and, therefore, is not counted for purposes of determining whether the       stockholder proposal has been approved.</p>

              <p><strong>PROPONENT'S RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE:</strong></p>
              <p><a name="1" id="1"><strong>1</strong></a><strong>.</strong> This is the <em>Board of   Directors'</em> response, addressed to the Corporation's owners.&nbsp; When   discussing potential conflicts of interest between a corporation's owners and   its board (as this Proposal does), it is confusing to refer to the board as   speaking for the corporation.&nbsp; I guess it's the Louis XIV model of   governance: &quot;L'&eacute;tat c'est moi.&quot;</p>
              <p><a name="2" id="2"><strong>2</strong></a><strong>. </strong>This Proposal would make   independent proxy voting advice available to all Oregon Steel shareowners, in   competition with the board's advice in the company-paid proxy.&nbsp; By thus   reducing the Board's influence, it may not be in the best interests <em>of the   Board</em>.</p>
              <p><a name="3" id="3"><strong>3</strong></a><strong>.</strong> As the Board mentions here,   the independent advisor's recommendation would <strong><em>add to</em></strong>, rather than   replace, the Board's recommendation on which way to vote. So shareowners could   benefit from both sources of advice.</p>
              <p><a name="4" id="4"><strong>4</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Shareowners would choose   the advisor based on its reputation in the financial community.&nbsp; Thus the   advisor would in effect be supervised by the financial community in maintaining   its reputation.&nbsp; Supervision by the Board would make the advisor no longer   independent of the Board, so the Proposal rules out Board supervision.</p>
              <p><a name="5" id="5"><strong>5</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Shareowners will   evaluate the need for this independent advice when they vote on this Proposal.&nbsp;   We shareowners need independent voting advice for the same reason we need to   have shareowner voting at all. If it were sufficient to simply vote following   the Board's recommendations then we wouldn't need to vote, but instead could   just leave all decisions to the Board. The reason why we have shareowner voting   is that there would be conflicts of interest inherent in leaving all decisions   to the Board.</p>
              <p><a name="6" id="6"><strong>6</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The quality of the advisor's work will be evaluated   by the financial community in determining the advisor's reputation, which will   affect future shareowner votes and thus the advisor's future business.</p>
              <p><a name="7" id="7"><strong>7</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The Proposal calls for   each advisor candidate to declare its fee in advance.&nbsp; Thus shareowners   would vote to choose an advisor with regard to the reasonableness of its   compensation for the work performed.</p>
              <p><strong><a name="8" id="8">8</a>.</strong> The Board could still evaluate the   engagement, services and compensation of these outside advisors, and give   recommendations to shareowners as to which advisor to select.&nbsp; However,   only shareowner vote would determine which advisor is selected and how much it   is compensated.</p>
              <p><strong><a name="9" id="9">9</a>.</strong> I agree that the company proxy should not be an   open forum. That is why the proposal calls for an entry fee, which can be   adjusted to deter all but the serious candidates.</p>
              <p><strong><a name="10" id="10">10</a>. </strong>An advisor would have to be known to shareowners   (by reputation) in order to win enough votes to be selected.&nbsp; Advisors   would be supervised by the financial community in determining reputation.</p>
              <p><strong><a name="11" id="11">11</a>.</strong> Paying an independent advisor would reduce the   need for shareowners to spend money on other advisors, including the Board.</p>
              <p><strong><a name="12" id="12">12</a>.</strong> While there is much public information available   about this company, it remains difficult for shareowners to decide on key proxy   matters, such as the appropriate form and amount of executive compensation.&nbsp;   And the Board has different interests than the shareowners in such matters.</p>
              <p><strong><a name="13" id="13">13</a>.</strong> This is a well-placed reminder of a voting system   biased against shareowners' interests and in favor of the incumbent Board's   interests.&nbsp; The Proposal would help shareowners vote more effectively, thus   reducing such bias.</p>
