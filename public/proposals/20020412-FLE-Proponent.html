		      <p>Re: <strong><u>Shareowner Proposal of Mark Latham to Fleetwood</u></strong></p>
		      <p>Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>
		      <p>I am writing in response to the March 22, 2002 letter (the      &quot;Fleetwood Letter&quot;) submitted to the Commission by      Ms. Jean Billyou on behalf of Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc.      (&quot;Fleetwood&quot; or the &quot;Company&quot;), which      expresses the Company&rsquo;s intention to omit from its proxy      statement for the 2002 annual meeting a shareowner proposal      (the &quot;Proposal&quot; or &quot;my Proposal&quot;)      submitted by me. The Proposal (attached) would request the      Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors to have the Company&rsquo;s      auditor selected annually by shareowner vote.</p>
		      <p>The Fleetwood Letter cites Rules 14a-8(i)(7)      (&lsquo;ordinary business&rsquo;), 14a-8(i)(1) (&lsquo;improper      under state law&rsquo;), and 14a-8(i)(3) (&lsquo;false and      misleading&rsquo;) as bases for its request for relief from      enforcement action. Reasons are given below why I believe the      Proposal may not be properly omitted under Rule 14a-8.</p>
		      <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Rule 14a-8(i)(7) -- &lsquo;ordinary business&rsquo;</u></strong></p>
		      <p>While the Proposal is the same as the one I submitted to      SONICblue Inc. last year, I respectfully request that the      Commission staff reconsider the &lsquo;ordinary business&rsquo;      issue.</p>
		      <p>The ordinary business of Fleetwood is making mobile homes.      Auditor selection is part of Fleetwood&rsquo;s corporate      governance structure, along with such matters as director      selection, executive stock option plan design, and whether or      not to have a poison pill. Because these corporate governance      issues involve potential conflicts between the interests of      senior management (including the Board of Directors) and      shareowners, it is appropriate for shareowners to have a      voice regarding them.</p>
		      <p>From SEC Release 34-40018 (May 21, 1998):</p>
		      <blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>&quot;Finally, we              believe that it would be useful to summarize the              principal considerations in the Division&rsquo;s              application, under the Commission&rsquo;s oversight,              of the &quot;ordinary business&quot; exclusion. The              general underlying policy of this exclusion is              consistent with the policy of most state corporate              laws: to confine the resolution of ordinary business              problems to management and the board of directors,              since it is impracticable for shareholders to decide              how to solve such problems at an annual shareholders              meeting.&quot;</p>
                </blockquote>
	          </blockquote>
		      <p>It is more practicable for shareowners to vote on auditor      selection than to vote on director selection, which they are      already doing. As the Proposal&rsquo;s supporting statement      points out:</p>
		      <blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>&quot;Investors could              decide how important auditor independence is to them,              and how it should be assessed.</p>
                  <p>The average investor              may seem ill-equipped to make such assessments on her              own. But she would not make them on her own. She              would benefit from consensus-building discussion by              the entire investment community, including proxy              advisory firms. It is much easier to assess              reputations of auditors than of board members,              because there are only a handful of auditing firms,              versus hundreds of board candidates for a diversified              portfolio of stocks over the years.&quot;</p>
                </blockquote>
	          </blockquote>
		      <p>The Commission staff recently disagreed with      &lsquo;ordinary business&rsquo; exclusion arguments regarding      proposals at <u>Walt Disney</u> (December 18, 2001) and      others, to prohibit an auditing firm from providing non-audit      services. My Proposal addresses the same fundamental issue:      auditor independence from undue influence by management.</p>
		      <p>Shareowners have recently become much more aware of and      sensitive to auditor independence and auditor reputations.      Stricter regulation of auditors can not solve the whole      problem. A market for auditor reputation (which my Proposal      would permit) could contribute to raising quality standards.</p>
		      <p>NYSE Rule 303.01 (mentioned in the Fleetwood Letter) was      designed to bolster auditor independence in a world where the      Board of Directors selects the auditor. It would be contrary      to the goal of this rule to use it as an obstacle to other      measures for improving auditor independence, such as my      Proposal. If necessary, the Board can request that Rule      303.01 be interpreted to accommodate the case of auditor      selection by shareowner vote.</p>
		      <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Rule 14a-8(i)(1) -- &lsquo;improper under state      law&rsquo;</u></strong></p>
		      <p>Because it is precatory, the Proposal mandates no board      action, and removes no authority from Fleetwood&rsquo;s Board      of Directors. The subject of the Proposal is a request for      action by the Board. The Proposal leaves open to      Fleetwood&rsquo;s Board several courses of action, none of      which would contravene Delaware state law:</p>
		      <blockquote>
                <p>1. Do nothing.</p>
		        <p>2. To the extent permissible under Delaware state law          and Fleetwood&rsquo;s bylaws and charter, implement the          Board&rsquo;s interpretation of the shareowners&rsquo;          request.</p>
		        <p>3. Amend Fleetwood&rsquo;s bylaws and charter, if          necessary with the approval of shareowners, to permit          further implementation of the Proposal.</p>
	          </blockquote>
		      <p>For a proposal to <u>Washington Mutual</u> (February 22,      2000) that would let shareowners choose independent agents      for the company to hire, SEC staff deemed that it would not      be excludable under rule 14a-8(i)(1) if it is worded as a      request. The current Proposal is worded as a request.</p>
		      <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Rule 14a-8(i)(3) (&lsquo;false and misleading&rsquo;)</u></strong></p>
		      <p>The Fleetwood Letter claims that the Proposal is vague and      indefinite, comparing it with a proposal to <u>Connecticut      Natural Gas Corporation</u> (November 29, 1993) (the      &quot;CNGC Proposal&quot;). Although the subject matter is      similar, in terms of vagueness these two proposals are as      different as night and day. Here is the entire text of the      CNGC Proposal:</p>
		      <blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>&quot;I am formally              requesting the following proposal be included on the              proxy statement:</p>
                  <p>FROM: Proposal to              approve the appointment of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.              as auditors for the fiscal year. . .</p>
                  <p>TO: Proposal to              approve the appointment of one of the following              public accounting firms (choice of three) as auditors              for the fiscal year.</p>
                  <p>&dagger;&dagger;&dagger;&dagger;&dagger;              Option One or</p>
                  <p>&dagger;&dagger;&dagger;&dagger;&dagger;              Option Two or</p>
                  <p>&dagger;&dagger;&dagger;&dagger;&dagger;              Option Three&quot;</p>
                </blockquote>
	          </blockquote>
		      <p>As Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation&rsquo;s counsel      pointed out: &quot;The Proposal does not set forth any      proposed resolution for adoption by shareholders. It does not      contain any supporting statement, nor does it request that      any supporting statement be included in the Company's proxy      materials. It simply requests that the quoted text be      included in the Company's proxy statement distributed in      connection with the 1994 Annual Meeting.&quot;</p>
		      <p>By contrast, my Proposal sets forth a proposed resolution      for adoption by shareholders, and contains a supporting      statement.</p>
		      <p>Understandably, the Commission did not object to exclusion      of the CNGC Proposal, responding: &quot;There appears to be      some basis for your view that the proposal may be omitted      from the proxy materials in reliance on rule 14a-8(c)(3)      because the submission is vague and indefinite.&quot;      However, the Fleetwood Letter&rsquo;s claim that &quot;the      Staff granted the registrant&rsquo;s request &hellip; because      the proposal was ambiguous <u>as to the criteria for      selection of the auditors, the voting process by which the      auditors should be chosen, and the effect the proposal would      have on the board as a result of an affirmative vote</u>&quot;      has no basis in the no-action letter for the words I have      underlined.</p>
		      <p>Regarding the Fleetwood Letter&rsquo;s specific objections      to my Proposal: Because it is precatory, my Proposal allows      the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors discretion in      implementing it. Thus the Board can determine which      accounting firms are qualified, but are requested not to      limit shareowner choice beyond that.</p>
		      <p>The Fleetwood Letter is right to point out that the      balloting rules are important and must be determined. The      Board is capable of specifying them appropriately. For      example, a well known and effective way of determining a      majority winner when there are multiple candidates is to let      each voter rank the candidates, indicating first, second,      third choice and so on.</p>
		      <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Rule 14a-8(i)(3) (&lsquo;false and misleading&rsquo; re      website reference)</u></strong></p>
		      <p>The Fleetwood letter complains that the website referenced      in the Proposal&rsquo;s supporting statement (www.corpmon.com)      includes information irrelevant to the Proposal. However, the      supporting statement also references the January 15, 2002      issue of the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, which also includes      information irrelevant to the Proposal. It is normal for a      website and for a newspaper to cover a range of topics. This      is not misleading, because readers know how to identify the      relevant parts. At www.corpmon.com, the relevant parts are      clearly identified on the home page by links labelled      &quot;Fleetwood Enterprises&quot; and &quot;Auditor      Independence&quot;. The ability to have a computer search for      specific words and phrases makes finding desired information      even easier in this electronic medium.</p>
		      <p>Any website can change its contents over time; that is the      nature of the medium. But the Commission staff (e.g. in Legal      Bulletin No. 14, July 13, 2001) has not deemed this to be      sufficient reason for excluding website references from      shareowner proposals. One way to alleviate some of the      concerns expressed in the Fleetwood Letter is to create a      link from the referenced website to Fleetwood&rsquo;s website,      thus enabling Fleetwood&rsquo;s Board to present its side of      the debate to readers browsing through. In fact, I have      included such a link to Fleetwood &rsquo;s website, ever since      submitting the Proposal in January.</p>
		      <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
		      <p>Based on the foregoing, I respectfully request that the      Commission staff not concur with the views expressed in the      Fleetwood Letter regarding exclusion of the Proposal from the      Fleetwood proxy statement. Please contact me with any      questions about this submission.</p>
		      <p>Very truly yours,</p>
