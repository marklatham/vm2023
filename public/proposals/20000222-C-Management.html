                <p>Re: Stockholder Proposal to Citigroup Inc.          (&quot;Citigroup&quot;) of Mark Latham, Ph.D.</p>
	          </blockquote>
		      <p>Dear Sir or Madam:</p>
		      <p>Mr. Latham submitted a proposal relating to the hiring of      an advisory firm for stockholders to Citigroup on November 2,      1999 for inclusion in its proxy statement. Citigroup filed a      no action request with the Securities and Exchange Commission      on December 22, 1999. Mr. Latham filed a response on January      10, 2000 and Citigroup responded on January 18, 2000. Mr.      Latham filed a response on January 31, 2000. This is in      response to Mr. Latham&rsquo;s January 31, 2000 letter.</p>
		      <p>In addition to the items raised in Citigroup&rsquo;s      submissions dated December 22, 1999 and January 18, 2000,      Citigroup submits that Mr. Latham&rsquo;s proposal may be      omitted from Citigroup&rsquo;s proxy materials because it      relates to election for membership on Citigroup&rsquo;s board      of directors in violation of Rule 14a-8(i)(8). Rule      14a-8(i)(8) allows the exclusion of proposal if it      &quot;relates to an election for membership on the      company&rsquo;s board of directors.&quot; The SEC has stated      that the &quot;principal purpose of [paragraph (c)(8)      (renumbered (i)(8)] is to make clear, with respect to      corporate elections, that Rule 14a-8 is not the proper means      for conducting campaigns or effecting reforms in elections of      that nature, since the proxy rules, including Rule 14a-11,      are applicable.&quot; Release No. 34-12598 (July7, 1976).</p>
		      <p>Mr. Latham&rsquo;s proposal would allow a proxy advisory      firm to render advice to stockholders on the election of      directors. Undoubtedly, from time to time the advice will      include a recommendation to vote against one or more of      management&rsquo;s candidates. Solicitations to vote against      management candidates fall within the parameters of Rule      14a-11 which contains certain procedural and disclosure      obligations designed to protect stockholders in election      contests and are not proper subject matter for stockholder      proposals. In both his original proposal and his January 31,      2000 letter, Mr. Latham anticipates that once stockholders      have the advice of a proxy advisor, they might no longer      follow management&rsquo;s recommendations. Mr. Latham&rsquo;s      letter of January 31, 2000 states as follows: &quot;While it      [information proxy statements typically provide about      director candidates] may be accurate, it is not sufficient      for discerning a candidate&rsquo;s effectiveness and degree of      loyalty to shareowner interests. That is why shareowner      voting on directors remains a mere formality in all but a few      cases.&quot; Mr. Latham concludes that advisory firms will be      able to give advice on proxy matters that &quot;will have the      independence that management&rsquo;s advice lacks.&quot; The      supporting statement to his original proposal reads as      follows: &quot;This proposal can be expected to improve the      return on Citigroup stock by:...-effectively enfranchising      individual investors for the first time, ensuring that a      majority of shares can be voted independently of      management&rsquo;s recommendations.&quot;</p>
		      <p>The Staff has stated on more than one occasion that the      presence of Rule 14a-11 in the proxy rules indicates that      &quot; the shareholder proposal process is not the proper      means for conducting election contests.&quot; See Computer      Network Corporation (June 16, 1983) and Bank of Montana      Systems (April 8, 1982). The Staff has consistently found      that proposal which attempt to circumvent the requirements of      Rule 14a-11 by using the shreholder proposal process may be      omitted. See BellSouth Corp. ( February 4,1998) (by-law      amendment to include shareholder nominees in proxy statement      and proxy card even if management recommends a vote against      nominee excludable because proposal, rather than establishing      procedures for nomination or qualification generally, would      establish a procedure that may result in contested elections      of directors, which is a matter more appropriately addressed      under Rule 14a-11); Unocal Corporation (February 6, 1990)      (proposal requiring the registrant to include information      about shareholder nominee in its proxy material excludable      because proposal, rather than establishing procedures for      nomination or qualification generally, would establish a      procedure that may result in contested elections of      directors, which is a matter more appropriately addressed      under Rule 14a-11); and Amoco Corporation (February 14, 1990)      (proposal to allow shareholder nominations of directors      through a &quot;common ballot&quot; excludable because      proposal, rather than establishing procedures for nomination      or qualification generally, would establish a procedure that      may result in contested elections of directors, which is a      matter more appropriately addressed under Rule 14a-11).</p>
		      <p>Accordingly, Citigroup believes that the proposal may be      omitted under Rule 14a-8(i)(8).</p>

		      <p>Very truly yours,</p>
