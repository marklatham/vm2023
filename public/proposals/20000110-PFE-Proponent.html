		      <p>Re: <strong><u>Shareowner Proposal of James McRitchie &amp;      Myra Young to Pfizer</u></strong></p>
		      <p>Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>
		      <p>On behalf of Mr. James McRitchie and Ms. Myra Young      (collectively, the &quot;Proponent&quot;), I am writing in      response to the December 21, 1999 letter (the &quot;Pfizer      Letter&quot;) submitted to the Commission by Pfizer, Inc.      (&quot;Pfizer&quot; or the &quot;Company&quot;), which      expresses the Company&rsquo;s intention to omit from its proxy      statement for the 2000 annual meeting a shareowner proposal      (the &quot;Proposal&quot;) submitted by the Proponent. The      Proposal (attached hereto with a letter authorizing me to      represent the Proponent) asks the shareowners to request the      Company to hire for one year a proxy advisory firm to be      chosen by the shareowners.</p>
		      <p>The Pfizer Letter cites Rules 14a-8(i)(7) (&lsquo;ordinary      business&rsquo;), 14a-8(i)(8) (&lsquo;relates to board      election&rsquo;), 14a-8(i)(3) (&lsquo;false and      misleading&rsquo;), 14a-8(i)(6) (&lsquo;beyond company&rsquo;s      power&rsquo;), and 14a-8(i)(1) (&lsquo;improper under state      law&rsquo;) as bases for its request for relief from      enforcement action. I suggest below some revisions to the      Proposal designed to alleviate some of the concerns expressed      in the Pfizer Letter. (The resulting &quot;Revised      Proposal&quot; is attached.) In addition, reasons are given      why I believe the Revised Proposal may not be properly      omitted under Rule 14a-8. Some of these reasons would apply      equally well to the (original) Proposal, while others gain      force because of the suggested revisions.</p>
		      <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Suggested revisions to the Proposal</u></strong></p>
		      <blockquote>
                <p>1. The Proposal is intended to be precatory. In order          to clarify this, I suggest changing its wording to          maintain consistently precatory language by:</p>
		        <blockquote>
                  <p>(a) replacing &quot;RESOLVED that Pfizer              hire&quot; with &quot;RESOLVED that Pfizer              shareowners request the Board of Directors to              hire&quot;;</p>
		          <p>(b) consequently simplifying the next sentence by              replacing &quot;Pfizer shareowners request the Board              of Directors to take&quot; with &quot;Shareowners              request the Board to take&quot;; and</p>
		          <p>(c) in the subsequent part of the resolution              (before the supporting statement), replace              &quot;can&quot; with &quot;could&quot;, and replace              &quot;is&quot; with &quot;would be&quot; (see              attached Revised Proposal for exact wording), thus              indicating that it is all conditional on the              Board&rsquo;s decisions.</p>
	            </blockquote>
		        <p>2. For reasons given below in the section on Rule          14a-8(i)(8), I suggest deleting the phrase &quot;nominate          board members&quot; from the supporting statement.</p>
		        <p>3. I recently heard from the editor of the journal <em>Gouvernance</em> that my article entitled &quot;The Internet Will Drive          Corporate Monitoring&quot; will not be in their Winter          2000 issue as had been planned, but is slated for their          Spring 2000 issue instead. Since references to future          publications can not be considered guaranteed, I suggest          deleting the reference to <em>Gouvernance</em>, as in the          attached Revised Proposal.</p>
	          </blockquote>
		      <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Rule 14a-8(i)(7) -- &lsquo;ordinary business&rsquo;</u></strong></p>
		      <blockquote>
                <p><u>Summary:</u></p>
		        <p>1. The Revised Proposal is designed to improve          corporate governance, which is not an ordinary business          matter.</p>
		        <p>2. The Revised Proposal asks for the hiring of a proxy          advisory firm, but would not restrict the Company from          hiring any other external consultants. So it would not          interfere with the Company&rsquo;s ordinary business          operations.</p>
		        <p>3. Choosing a proxy advisory firm is well within the          capabilities of shareowners. It is easier than voting          intelligently on compensation plans, director candidates,          and most other proposals. On these more complex matters,          shareowners will be better able to vote with the benefit          of independent advice if the Revised Proposal is          implemented. </p>
		        <p>4. Unlike <em>Johnson Controls, Inc.</em> (October 26,          1999), the subject matter of the additional disclosure          resulting from the Revised Proposal would relate          exclusively to shareowner voting, and thus not to          ordinary business matters.</p>
		        <p><u>Detail:</u></p>
	          </blockquote>
		      <p>This is a corporate governance proposal. While the Company      may hire consultants as part of its ordinary business, the      Revised Proposal would in effect enable shareowners to hire      consultants (a proxy advisory firm). The Revised Proposal      would not prevent the Company from hiring consultants, so it      does not interfere with the Company&rsquo;s ordinary business      operations. The Pfizer Letter thus makes an overly broad      interpretation of Rule 14a-8(i)(7).</p>
		      <p>Rule 14a-8(i) is part of a tradeoff between enabling      shareowners to have a voice in appropriate ways on the one      hand, and excluding counterproductive uses of the proposal      mechanism on the other. Rule 14a-8(i)(7), the &lsquo;ordinary      business&rsquo; exclusion, is more specifically about the      tradeoff between shareowner voice and excess micro-management      of decisions better left to management. The problem of      optimizing this tradeoff is exactly what the Revised Proposal      is designed to solve. Choosing a proxy advisory firm will be      no more difficult a decision for shareowners than other      matters they are asked to vote on, including compensation      plans, directors, and most proposals. Once a proxy advisor      has been hired, shareholders are likely to be better informed      and better prepared to vote on other proxy issues.</p>
		      <p>Most institutional investors are aware of the reputations      of proxy advisory firms, but most individual investors are      not. However, individuals will quickly and easily learn those      reputations if the Revised Proposal is implemented. This is      practical because there is a manageable number of advisory      firms. By contrast, director elections rarely provide an      effective voice for shareowners, because potential director      candidates nationwide for board seats at companies in a      typical investor&rsquo;s portfolio number in the hundreds. SEC      Release 34-40018 (May 21, 1998) states that the      &lsquo;ordinary business&rsquo; rule is designed to exclude      proposals &quot;probing too deeply into matters of a complex      nature upon which shareholders, as a group, would not be in a      position to make an informed judgment.&quot; It is easier to      make an informed judgment about proxy advisory firms than      about directors. Since shareholders are expected to vote on      directors, they must be in an even better position to vote on      advisory firms.</p>
		      <p>Similarly, analyzing a stock-option plan is complex for      the typical individual investor. Like many institutional      investors, they will benefit from an independent analysis to      aid their voting. Thus the Revised Proposal would give      shareowners much more informed and effective voice.</p>
		      <p><u>Responses to other points in the Pfizer Letter:</u></p>
		      <p>Regarding the last paragraph on page 3, the timeframe for      implementing the Revised Proposal allows plenty of time for      the SEC to clarify these points. It would make sense for a      company not to be responsible for the independent proxy      voting advice envisioned in the Revised Proposal. In that      case the additional costs referred to here would not be      necessary.</p>
		      <p>Regarding the first paragraph on page 4, while the <em>Nalco      Chemical</em> and <em>Montana Power</em> proposals dealt with      shareholder communications, they would not have materially      affected corporate governance. The Revised Proposal here is a      corporate governance proposal, and therefore not an ordinary      business matter. It is not just about shareholder      communication techniques, but would add importantly to the      content of those communications. The Sonat finding likewise      was not in a corporate governance matter. </p>
		      <p>In <em>Johnson Controls, Inc.</em> (October 26, 1999),      Commission staff &quot;determined that proposals requesting      additional disclosures in Commission-prescribed documents      should not be omitted under the &lsquo;ordinary business&rsquo;      exclusion solely because they relate to the preparation and      content of documents filed with or submitted to the      Commission. &hellip;we therefore will consider whether the      subject matter of the additional disclosure sought in a      particular proposal involves a matter of ordinary business;      where it does, we believe it may be excluded under rule      14a-8(i)(7).&quot; The Revised Proposal would involve      including information in proxy materials that relates only to      shareowner voting. Matters of ordinary business are not put      to shareowner vote. Thus the subject matter of the additional      disclosure will not be ordinary business, so is not grounds      for exclusion.</p>
		      <p>Regarding Part B, hiring an independent firm to advise      stockholders is not part of Pfizer&rsquo;s day-to-day      management, nor would it interfere with management&rsquo;s      ability to run the company. The advisory firm would advise      shareowners on how to vote their stock. Shareowner voting,      however informed, does not undermine these director      responsibilities.</p>
		      <p>Regarding Part C, all the additional information to be      included in the proxy materials because of the Revised      Proposal, relates to shareowner voting, and thus to the      Company&rsquo;s corporate governance, not its ordinary      business.</p>
		      <p>Regarding Part D, these practical considerations, while      significant, can certainly be determined appropriately by the      Board, in cooperation with the proxy advisory firm and the      SEC, if necessary. Attempting to specify such details in the      Revised Proposal would be micro-management.</p>
		      <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Rule 14a-8(i)(8) -- &lsquo;relates to board      election&rsquo;</u></strong></p>
		      <p>The Revised Proposal makes no attempt to substitute for or      subvert the separate process for election contests (e.g. Rule      14a-12 relating to election contests). It would simply give      all shareowners access to information which is available now      only to some shareowners. For example, in contrast to <em>Amoco      Corp.</em> (February 14, 1990), which involved a proposal to      enable owners of $100,000 worth of shares to include their      board nominees in the company&rsquo;s proxy materials, the      Revised Proposal would not change the director nomination or      election process. The Pfizer Letter&rsquo;s argument thus      relies on an overly broad interpretation of Rule 14a-8(i)(8).</p>
		      <p>In order to clarify this issue, I suggest deleting the      phrase &quot;nominate board members&quot; from the supporting      statement. The Revised Proposal reflects this change.</p>
		      <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Rules 14a-8(i)(3) (&lsquo;false and misleading&rsquo;)      and 14a-8(i)(6) (&lsquo;beyond company&rsquo;s power&rsquo;)</u></strong></p>
		      <p>The Revised Proposal names three leading proxy advisory      firms, gives their website locations, and refers to Wall      Street Journal articles that describe their reputations and      services. Further depth of information about the advisory      business and how it would work in conjunction with the      Revised Proposal can be found through the other websites      mentioned. Thus plenty of information on these matters is      available to Pfizer shareowners.</p>
		      <p>The Revised Proposal emphasizes competition among advisory      firms who build reputations for serving shareowner interests.      This competitive force will work better in a flexible      framework, rather than if we are overly specific in advance      about the form and content of advice.</p>
		      <p>The Revised Proposal specifies a sequence of actions,      schedule, and price guidelines sufficient for shareowners to      understand what is envisioned. The practical details raised      here in the Pfizer Letter are significant, but can be decided      in an appropriate manner by the Pfizer Board. Especially      given the rapid pace of evolution of telecommunications, it      would not be desirable for the Revised Proposal to specify,      to the point of micro-management, the details of how voting      analysis should be distributed. An appropriate balance can be      determined between the need for brevity in the proxy      statement and the desire of some shareowners for more detail.      Both these goals can be served by such means as printing      summaries in the proxy materials, with references to more      detailed information on the internet.</p>
		      <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Rule 14a-8(i)(1) -- &lsquo;improper under state      law&rsquo;</u></strong></p>
		      <p>The Revised Proposal is clearly precatory. As such, it      removes no authority from Pfizer&rsquo;s Board of Directors.      The subject of the Revised Proposal is a request for action      by the Board, not for action by shareholders. The fact that      implementation by the Board would later permit certain      shareholder action, does not change the Revised      Proposal&rsquo;s fundamental precatory nature.</p>
		      <p>The Revised Proposal does not prevent Pfizer&rsquo;s      directors from continuing to make determinations and      recommendations on behalf of the Company. The Revised      Proposal simply provides a mechanism for all shareowners to      get proxy voting advice which many shareowners are already      getting now. That would result in more informed voting, to      the benefit all shareowners. The existing system of proxy      voting advice is not contrary to Delaware law, so there is no      reason why the proposed system would be contrary to Delaware      law, since it is more equitable in the distribution of and      payment for information, as well as beneficial to investors.</p>
		      <p>It is within the power of Pfizer&rsquo;s Board and      shareowners to amend Pfizer&rsquo;s bylaws and certificate of      incorporation. This could be done if necessary to allow      implementation of the measures requested in the Revised      Proposal, without contravening Section 141(a) of the Delaware      General Corporation Law. So the Revised Proposal does not      request anything that is improper under Delaware state law.</p>
		      <p>With reference to the followup SEC no-action letter on the      revised <em>Pennzoil</em> proposal (March 22, 1993) and the <em>Radiation      Care</em> no-action letter (December 22, 1994), the Revised      Proposal here does not call for and would not require &quot;a      by-law provision that specifies that it may be amended only      by shareholders&quot;, so would not contravene Delaware law      in that respect either.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;</p>
		      <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Rule 14a-8(d), re omitting reference to web sites</u></strong></p>
		      <p>In section V., Pfizer argues inclusion of the Corporate      Monitoring internet address &quot;subverts the intent of the      500-word limit of Rule 14a-8(d)&quot; and that it is      &quot;misleading because the data incorporated by reference      has not been furnished by either Pfizer or the      Proponent.&quot; Pfizer cites the Templeton Dragon Fund      (Templeton) no-action letter as precedent.</p>
		      <p>In the case of Templeton, three objections were made: (1)      500 word limit exceeded, (2) data not furnished to SEC, and      (3) misleading because data Newgate claimed was on its      internet site was, in fact, not available. The SEC&rsquo;s      no-action letter on Templeton left unclear whether staff      agreed with all, or only one of the arguments. Our assumption      is the SEC agreed only with argument 3, since the other      arguments make little sense in light of the historical      development of the 500 word limit and the SEC&rsquo;s recent      initiatives to encourage direct dialogue among shareholders.</p>
		      <p>With regard to the 500 word limit: In its 1976 amendments      to Rule 14a-8 that, for the first time, imposed length      restrictions on the shareholder&rsquo;s resolution itself, as      well as on the supporting statement, the SEC noted that      extremely long resolutions not only &quot;constitute an      unreasonable exercise of the right to submit proposals at the      expense of other shareholders but also tend to obscure other      materials matters in the proxy statements of issuers, thereby      reducing the effectiveness of such documents.&quot; From      this, it is clear the intent of the 500-word limit is to keep      costs reasonable and to keep from obscuring other important      matters. Including the address of an internet site in the      proxy statement of Pfizer is consistent with both objectives.</p>
		      <p>Regarding the issue of prior review: In 1992 the SEC      adopted major amendments to its proxy rules in order to      eliminate much of the SEC&rsquo;s previous role as censor. At      that time, the SEC indicated that &quot;parties should be      free to reply to the statements in a timely and      cost-effective manner, challenging the basis for the claims      and countering with their own views on the subject matter      through the dissemination of additional soliciting      material.&quot; Prior review by the SEC is not required.      Surely Pfizer is fully capable of reviewing the material on      the Corporate Monitoring internet site and responding to it      by either including material with the proxy statement or by      posting their responses on their own internet site. This is      made especially feasible by such free internet services as      &quot;Mind-It&quot; at www.netmind.com, which sends automatic      e-mail notification when a specified web page changes its      content.</p>
		      <p>In order to ensure that shareholders are fully informed,      James McRitchie has included hyperlinks to the Pfizer site      within the text of the resolution which is posted at      www.corpgov.net/news/resolutions/pfizer.html. The Corporate      Monitoring site has also included hyperlinks to the Pfizer      site when the Pfizer resolution is referenced at      www.corpmon.com. We would hope that Pfizer would include      similar hyperlinks back to either or both of these sites in      the text of any reference to the resolution on their own      site.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;</p>
		      <p>The SEC has the option to allow a proposal to be included      if the proponent makes specified revisions. We would      willingly remove the address of the Corporate Monitoring site      if such action is required by the SEC in order to have the      proposal included with the proxy materials. However, we hope      the SEC will not require any such change. </p>
		      <p>References to quotations cited above can be found in      Howard Friedman&rsquo;s &quot;Commentary on a Rare Luddite      Victory - The Templeton Dragon Fund Shareholder Proposal      No-Action Letter,&quot; published in the Winter 1999 <em>Villanova      Journal of Law and Investment Management</em>. That paper also      provides an excellent discussion of further issues first      raised by the Templeton no-action letter.</p>

                  <strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
		      <p>Based on the foregoing, I respectfully request that the      Commission staff find that Pfizer lacks sufficient grounds      for excluding the Revised Proposal from its proxy statement.
