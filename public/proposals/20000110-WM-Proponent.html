		      <p>Re: <strong><u>Shareowner Proposal of Jerome Gabig to      Washington Mutual, Inc.</u></strong></p>
		      <p>Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>
		      <p>On behalf of Mr. Jerome Gabig (&quot;Mr. Gabig&quot; or      the &quot;Proponent&quot;), I am writing in response to the      December 15, 1999 letter (the &quot;WM Letter&quot;) of      Heller Ehrman White &amp; McAuliffe submitted to the      Commission on behalf of Washington Mutual, Inc.      (&quot;Washington Mutual&quot; or the &quot;Company&quot;),      which expresses the Company&rsquo;s intention to omit from its      proxy statement for the 2000 annual meeting a shareowner      proposal (the &quot;Proposal&quot;) submitted by Mr. Gabig.      The Proposal, attached hereto with Mr. Gabig&rsquo;s November      14, 1999 cover letter, asks the shareowners to request the      Company to hire for one year a proxy advisory firm to be      chosen by the shareowners.</p>
		      <p>The WM Letter cites Rules 14a-8(i)(7) (&lsquo;ordinary      business&rsquo;) and 14a-8(i)(1) (&lsquo;improper under state      law&rsquo;) as bases for its request for relief from      enforcement action. I suggest below some revisions to the      Proposal designed to alleviate some of the concerns expressed      in the WM Letter. (The resulting &quot;Revised Proposal&quot;      is attached.) In addition, reasons are given why I believe      the Revised Proposal may not be properly omitted under Rule      14a-8. Some of these reasons would apply equally well to the      (original) Proposal, while others gain force because of the      suggested revisions.</p>
		      <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Suggested revisions to the Proposal</u></strong></p>
		      <blockquote>
                <p>1. The Proposal is intended to be precatory. In order          to clarify this, I suggest changing its wording to          maintain consistently precatory language by:</p>
		        <blockquote>
                  <p>(a) replacing &quot;RESOLVED that the Company              hire&quot; with &quot;RESOLVED that Washington Mutual              shareowners request the Board of Directors to              hire&quot;;</p>
		          <p>(b) consequently simplifying the next sentence by              replacing &quot;Washington Mutual shareowners request              the Board of Directors to take&quot; with              &quot;Shareowners request the Board to take&quot;;              and</p>
		          <p>(c) in the subsequent part of the resolution              (before the supporting statement), replace              &quot;can&quot; with &quot;could&quot;, and replace              &quot;is&quot; with &quot;would be&quot; (see              attached Revised Proposal for exact wording), thus              indicating that it is all conditional on the              Board&rsquo;s decisions.</p>
	            </blockquote>
		        <p>2. I recently heard from the editor of the journal <em>Gouvernance</em> that my article entitled &quot;The Internet Will Drive          Corporate Monitoring&quot; will not be in their Winter          2000 issue as had been planned, but is slated for their          Spring 2000 issue instead. Since references to future          publications can not be considered guaranteed, I suggest          deleting the reference to <em>Gouvernance</em>, as in the          attached Revised Proposal.</p>
	          </blockquote>
		      <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Rule 14a-8(i)(7) -- &lsquo;ordinary business&rsquo;</u></strong></p>
		      <blockquote>
                <p><u>Summary:</u></p>
		        <p>1. The Revised Proposal is designed to improve          corporate governance, which is not an ordinary business          matter.</p>
		        <p>2. The Revised Proposal asks for the hiring of a proxy          advisory firm, but would not restrict the Company from          hiring any other external consultants. So it would not          interfere with the Company&rsquo;s ordinary business          operations.</p>
		        <p>3. Choosing a proxy advisory firm is well within the          capabilities of shareowners. It is easier than voting          intelligently on compensation plans, director candidates,          and most other proposals. On these more complex matters,          shareowners will be better able to vote with the benefit          of independent advice if the Revised Proposal is          implemented. </p>
		        <p>4. Unlike <em>Johnson Controls, Inc.</em> (October 26,          1999) and <em>Bob Evans Farms, Inc.</em> (June 23, 1997),          the Revised Proposal would relate exclusively to          shareowner voting, and thus not to ordinary business          matters.</p>
		        <p><u>Detail:</u></p>
	          </blockquote>
		      <p>This is a corporate governance proposal. While the Company      may hire consultants as part of its ordinary business, the      Revised Proposal would in effect enable shareowners to hire      consultants (a proxy advisory firm). The Revised Proposal      would not prevent the Company from hiring consultants, so it      does not interfere with the Company&rsquo;s ordinary business      operations. The WM Letter thus makes an overly broad      interpretation of Rule 14a-8(i)(7).</p>
		      <p>Rule 14a-8(i) is part of a tradeoff between enabling      shareowners to have a voice in appropriate ways on the one      hand, and excluding counterproductive uses of the proposal      mechanism on the other. Rule 14a-8(i)(7), the &lsquo;ordinary      business&rsquo; exclusion, is more specifically about the      tradeoff between shareowner voice and excess micro-management      of decisions better left to management. The problem of      optimizing this tradeoff is exactly what the Revised Proposal      is designed to solve. Choosing a proxy advisory firm will be      an easier decision for shareowners than other matters they      are asked to vote on, including compensation plans,      directors, and most proposals. Once a proxy advisor has been      hired, shareholders are likely to be better informed and      better prepared to vote on other proxy issues.</p>
		      <p>Most institutional investors are aware of the reputations      of proxy advisory firms, but most individual investors are      not. However, individuals will quickly and easily learn those      reputations if the Revised Proposal is implemented. That will      happen in much the same way that consumers have learned how      to buy personal computers (PCs). Before PCs became a      mass-market product, most consumers knew little about them or      their manufacturers&rsquo; reputations. But when many people      became interested in buying them, they did not have to be      electrical engineers to be able to choose good quality PCs.      Reviews in the media assessed and compared PC brand      reputations. Availability of this information and competition      among brands have brought great responsiveness to customer      needs.</p>
		      <p>This evolution of media coverage will happen much faster      for proxy advisory firm reputations than it did for PC      makers, because the advisory business is already well      established, and advisor reputations are well known among      institutional investors. They need only be communicated to      individuals by the media.</p>
		      <p>A key factor here is the number of major PC brands. If      there were hundreds, it would not be practical for consumers      to learn all their reputations. Likewise for proxy advisory      firms: this system will work because there are not too many      of them. By contrast, director elections rarely provide an      effective voice for shareowners, because potential director      candidates nationwide for board seats at companies in a      typical investor&rsquo;s portfolio number in the hundreds. SEC      Release 34-40018 (May 21, 1998) states that the      &lsquo;ordinary business&rsquo; rule is designed to exclude      proposals &quot;probing too deeply into matters of a complex      nature upon which shareholders, as a group, would not be in a      position to make an informed judgment&quot;. It is easier to      make an informed judgment about proxy advisory firms than      about directors. Since shareholders are expected to vote on      directors, they must be in an even better position to vote on      advisory firms.</p>
		      <p>As with assessing director quality, analyzing a      stock-option compensation plan is very complex for the      typical individual investor, yet they are often asked to vote      on such plans. Like many institutional investors, they will      benefit from an independent analysis to aid their voting.      Thus the Revised Proposal would give shareowners much more      informed and effective voice. </p>
		      <p>In <em>Johnson Controls, Inc.</em> (October 26, 1999),      Commission staff &quot;determined that proposals requesting      additional disclosures in Commission-prescribed documents      should not be omitted under the &lsquo;ordinary business&rsquo;      exclusion solely because they relate to the preparation and      content of documents filed with or submitted to the      Commission. &hellip;we therefore will consider whether the      subject matter of the additional disclosure sought in a      particular proposal involves a matter of ordinary business;      where it does, we believe it may be excluded under rule      14a-8(i)(7).&quot; The Revised Proposal would involve      including information in proxy materials that relates only to      shareowner voting. Matters of ordinary business are not put      to shareowner vote. Thus the subject matter of the additional      disclosure will not be ordinary business, so is not grounds      for exclusion.</p>
		      <p>In <em>Bob Evans Farms, Inc.</em> (June 23, 1997), a      shareowner proposed that the company hire a consulting firm      to advise the board and management how to improve the      company&rsquo;s financial performance. In contrast, the      Revised Proposal here seeks advice for shareowners on voting.      Again, matters of ordinary business are not put to shareowner      vote, so this advice would not relate to ordinary business.</p>
		      <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Rule 14a-8(i)(1) -- &lsquo;improper under state      law&rsquo;</u></strong></p>
		      <p>Because it is precatory, the Revised Proposal removes no      authority from Washington Mutual&rsquo;s Board of Directors.      The subject of the Revised Proposal is a request for action      by the Board, not for action by shareholders. The fact that      implementation by the Board would later permit certain      shareholder action, does not change the Revised      Proposal&rsquo;s fundamental precatory nature.</p>
		      <p>The Revised Proposal leaves open to Washington      Mutual&rsquo;s Board several courses of action, none of which      would contravene Washington state law:</p>
		      <blockquote>
                <p>1. Do nothing.</p>
		        <p>2. To the extent permissible under Washington state          law and Washington Mutual&rsquo;s bylaws and certificate          of incorporation, implement the Board&rsquo;s          interpretation of the shareowners&rsquo; request.</p>
		        <p>3. Amend Washington Mutual&rsquo;s bylaws and          certificate of incorporation, if necessary with the          approval of shareowners, to permit implementation of the          Revised Proposal.</p>
	          </blockquote>
		      <p><br />
                  <strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
		      <p>Based on the foregoing, I respectfully request that the      Commission staff find that Washington Mutual lacks sufficient      grounds for excluding the Revised Proposal from its proxy      statement. Please call me at (415) 391-7198, or e-mail me at      mlatham@corpmon.com, with any questions about this      submission.</p>
