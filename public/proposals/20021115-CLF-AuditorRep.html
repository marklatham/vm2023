		    <p><em>Submitted to Cleveland-Cliffs on November 15, 2002 by shareowner Mark Latham:</em></p>

		    <h3><strong>AUDITOR REPUTATION PROPOSAL </strong></h3>
		    <blockquote>
              <p>WHEREAS auditor selection     by boards of directors encourages auditors to give board-friendly audits;</p>
		      <p>WHEREAS shareowners would     be better served by tougher audits;</p>
		      <p>THEREFORE     Cleveland-Cliffs Inc shareowners request the Board of Directors to conduct an     annual poll of auditor reputation, so as to encourage auditors to build their     reputations for serving shareowner interests.&nbsp; The poll would be conducted by     including in the Company proxy an item asking each shareowner to rank two or     more specified auditing firms. &nbsp;The Board would choose which auditors to     include in the poll.&nbsp; The tabulated results of the poll would be released to     the news media.</p>
		      <p>The Board would still     choose the Company&rsquo;s auditor.&nbsp; The poll would be in addition to the usual     proxy item in which shareowners ratify the Board&rsquo;s auditor selection.</p>
		      <p><u>Supporting Statement:</u></p>
		      <p><em>Wall Street Journal</em>,     January 15, 2002:</p>
		      <p> &ldquo;<strong>The     accounting industry is in urgent need of reform.<br />
              </strong>The Enron fiasco is only the latest in a string of episodes involving Big     5 accounting firms in which outside auditors repeatedly blessed questionable     financial maneuvers -- until companies&rsquo; fortunes collapsed under mountains of     previously undisclosed debt and phony profits.&rdquo;</p>
		      <p><em>The Economist</em>,     October 28, 2000:</p>
		      <p> &ldquo;There is plenty     of evidence that financial statements often fail to come up to scratch. The     number of companies restating their accounts&mdash;never in ways that make them     appear healthier&mdash;has been rising so fast as to have become almost commonplace.     Well-known firms whose audited profits shrunk in a restatement include Waste     Management, Sunbeam and CUC International, during its merger with Cendant.     Investors have lost billions of dollars, and much of their faith in auditors.&rdquo;</p>
		      <p>This proposal would     encourage auditors to build their reputations in the eyes of investors as well     as in the eyes of management, creating new pressure for higher standards.</p>
		      <p>The average investor may     seem ill-equipped to assess auditor reputation on her own.&nbsp; But she need not     do this on her own.&nbsp; She would benefit from consensus-building discussion by     the entire investment community.&nbsp; It is much easier to assess and communicate     reputations of auditors than of board members for example, because there are     only a handful of auditing firms, versus hundreds of board candidates for a     diversified portfolio of stocks over the years.</p>
		      <p>Even though the Board     would continue to select the Company&rsquo;s auditor, a public ranking of auditor     reputation among shareowners would push auditors and boards to give greater     weight to shareowner concerns.&nbsp; This is not to imply that there are accounting     biases at Cleveland-Cliffs Inc in particular, but no one knows when and where     problems may occur.</p>
		      <p>Further information on     this proposal is on the Corporate Monitoring website at <a href="http://www.corpmon.com">www.corpmon.com</a> .</p>
