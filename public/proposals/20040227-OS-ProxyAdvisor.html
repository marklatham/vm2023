		    <p><em>Proposal revision submitted to Oregon Steel on February 27, 2004 by shareowner Mark Latham:</em></p>
		    <hr />
		    <h3><strong> PROXY ADVISOR PROPOSAL </strong></h3>
		    <blockquote>
              <p>WHEREAS many shareowners       lack the time and expertise to make the best voting decisions, yet prefer       not to always follow directors&rsquo; recommendations, because of possible       conflicts of interest;</p>
		      <p>WHEREAS shareowners have a       common interest in obtaining sound independent advice, but often       insufficient private interest to justify paying for it individually (the       &ldquo;free-rider&rdquo; problem);</p>
		      <p>THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED       that Oregon Steel Mills, Inc. shareowners request the Board of Directors to hire a proxy       advisory firm for one year, to be chosen by shareowner vote.&nbsp; Shareowners       request the Board to take all necessary steps to enact this resolution in       time to hold the vote at the year-2005 shareowner meeting, with the       following features:</p>
		      <blockquote>
		        <p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;      To insulate advisor selection from influence by       the Corporation's management, any proxy advisory firm could put itself on the ballot       by paying an entry fee, declaring the price (no more than $8000) for       advisory services for the coming year, and providing the address of a       website describing their proposed services and qualifications.</p>
		        <p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;      The winning candidate would be paid its declared       price by the Corporation, and make advice freely available to all       Corporation       shareowners for the subsequent year, on all matters put to shareowner vote       except director elections.&nbsp; (Advice on director elections is excluded to       satisfy SEC rule 14a-8(i)(8).)</p>
		        <p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Performance of the advisory firm would not be       policed by the Corporation's management, but rather by gain or loss of the advisor&rsquo;s       reputation and future business.</p>
		        <p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Brief summary advice could be included in the       Corporation proxy, with references to a website and/or a toll-free phone number       for more detail.</p>
		        <p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;      The decision of whether to hire proxy advisory       firms in later years would be left open.</p>
	          </blockquote>
		      <p><u>Supporting Statement:</u></p>
		      <p>The proxy advisor would be       paid with Corporation funds to give shareowners an independent professional       opinion.&nbsp; Independence would be further enhanced by having shareowners       choose the proxy advisor.&nbsp; This could also increase competition in the proxy       advisory business, because new entrants could earn fees on a       company-by-company basis, without covering thousands of companies.</p>
		      <p><em>Wall Street Journal</em> (July 26, 2001) article &ldquo;After This Deal, Is Anyone Left to Give Advice?&rdquo;:       &ldquo;&hellip;Proxy Monitor Inc. has agreed to buy Institutional Shareholder Services&hellip; A       monopoly of shareholder advice doesn&rsquo;t sit well with some.&rdquo;</p>
		      <p><em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> (May 18, 2003) article &ldquo;Battle of the Ballot&rdquo;: &ldquo;State Street out-sources its       proxy voting operation to Institutional Shareholder Services.&rdquo;</p>
		      <p>Example of lack of time       and expertise: <a href="http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=19682916"> http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=19682916</a> : &ldquo;I tried to read the       proxy statement, but I still don't understand whether the change is       shareholder friendly or not.&rdquo;</p>
		      <p>Mistrust of boards: Harris       Poll, September 2003, at <a href="http://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s71903/gmcentee092403.pdf"> www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s71903/gmcentee092403.pdf</a> : &ldquo;Support for       corporate management nominees is also mixed with majorities of shareholders       having <em>withheld support</em> from a management nominee.&rdquo;</p>
		      <p>The conflicts of interest       among managers, directors and shareowners are described in Robert Monks and       Nell Minow&rsquo;s 1996 book <em>Watching the Watchers</em>, along with shareowners&rsquo;       &ldquo;free rider&rdquo; and &ldquo;rational ignorance&rdquo; problems.</p>
