              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="center"><strong>STATEMENT OF INTENT TO      OMIT STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Citigroup Inc., a Delaware corporation      (&quot;Citigroup&quot; or the &quot;Company&quot;), intends      to omit the stockholder proposal and supporting statement      (the &quot;Proposal,&quot; a copy of which is annexed hereto      as Exhibit A) submitted by Mark Latham, Ph.D. (the      &quot;Proponent&quot;) for inclusion in its proxy statement      and form of proxy (together, the &quot;2000 Proxy      Materials&quot;) to be distributed to stockholders in      connection with the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held      on April 18, 2000.</p>
              <p>The Proposal requests the Company to      conduct a bidding process at the 2001 Annual Meeting in order      to retain a proxy advisory firm selected by a vote of the      Company&rsquo;s stockholders at the Annual Meeting.</p>
              <p>It is Citigroup&rsquo;s belief that the      Proposal may be omitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(7), Rule      14a-8(i)(4), and Rule 14a-8(i)(3). Rule 14a-8(i)(7) provides      that a proposal may be omitted if it &quot;deals with a      matter relating to the company&rsquo;s ordinary business      operations.&quot; Rule 14a-8(i)(4) provides that a proposal      may be omitted if it is &quot;designed to result in a      personal benefit to the proponent, or to further a personal      interest, which is not shared by the other shareholders at      large.&quot; Rule 14a-8(i)(3) provides that a proposal may be      omitted if it or the accompanying supporting statement      &quot;is contrary to any of the Commission&rsquo;s proxy      rules, including Section 240.a-9, which prohibits materially      false or misleading statements in proxy soliciting      materials.&quot;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                  <p><strong>THE PROPOSAL MAY BE OMITTED              BECAUSE IMPLEMENTATION WOULD REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO              (i) DISCLOSE SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION RELATED TO              ORDINARY BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN THE COMPANY&rsquo;S              PROXY STATEMENT AND (ii) RETAIN A CONSULTANT, MATTERS              THAT RELATE TO THE COMPANY&rsquo;S ORDINARY BUSINESS              OPERATIONS</strong></p>
                </blockquote>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The Proposal, insofar as it requests the      Company to retain the services of a proxy advisory firm      selected by a vote of the stockholders at the Company&rsquo;s      Annual Meeting in 200l, would infringe upon management&rsquo;s      decision-making functions concerning (i) disclosure in the      Company's proxy statement and (ii) retention of consultants.      It is well settled that decisions on such matters relate to      the Company&rsquo;s ordinary business operations, and      therefore, may be omitted pursuant to Rule      14a-8(i)(7).</p>
              <p>Implementation of the Proposal would      require Citigroup to provide supplementary disclosures in the      proxy statement that are not required by applicable laws or      regulations and relate to ordinary business operations. The      Staff of the Division of Corporate Finance      (&quot;Staff&quot;) has consistently declined to recommend      enforcement action against companies that omitted stockholder      proposals, which, if implemented, would require additional      disclosures in the companies&rsquo; proxy materials. See <u>Johnson      Controls, Inc</u>. (October 26, 1999) (additional reporting      in SEC-required disclosure materials that is related to      ordinary business operations may be excluded under Rule      14a-8(i)(7)); <u>RJR</u><strong><u> </u></strong><u>Nabisco Holdings      Corp</u>. (Feb. 22, 1999) and <u>International Business      Machines Corporation</u> (Jan. 19, 1999) (both proposals      request disclosure of company&rsquo;s relationships with      compensation consultants in proxy statement): <u>ConAgra, Inc</u>.      (June 10, 1998) (proposal to establish a political      contributions program and to provide comprehensive disclosure      on the recipients in the annual report: the Staff noted,      &quot;while the subject matter of political contributions      does not necessarily involve matters relating to the      company&rsquo;s ordinary business operations, we note in      particular that the proposal would, if implemented, require      the company to supplement the disclosures made in its annual      report on form 10-K and other periodic reports&quot;).</p>
              <p>The need for exclusion of this type of      proposal is further crystallized when one considers how      confusing the proxy statement and form of proxy would be to      stockholders if the Proposal were implemented. By conducting      a bid and selection process in the suggested forum, the      Company&rsquo;s Proxy Statement, the Proposal would implicitly      require the Company to explain in the proxy statement the      circumstances and rationale for the vote. In addition, under      the terms of the Proposal, &quot;any proxy advisory firm can      put itself on the ballot by paying an entry fee and declaring      the price for its service,&quot; which could result in an      unlimited number of candidates bidding for this business,      each of whom must be disclosed in the proxy statement and      listed on the proxy card. Citigroup submits that conducting a      bid process through proxy disclosure and in the course of an      annual meeting would confuse stockholders, and therefore, is      inappropriate.</p>
              <p>In Release No. 34-40018 (May 21, 1998), the      Securities and Exchange Commission (&quot;Commission&quot;)      cited a number of examples of matters that fall within the      purview of &quot;ordinary business operations&quot; and      should not be subject to shareholder oversight, including      decisions related to hiring and retention of suppliers. By      recommending that the Company hire a proxy advisory firm &mdash; essentially,      as a consultant/supplier to the Company&rsquo;s stockholders &mdash; the      examples cited by the Commission are broadly implicated.      There is ample support to exclude the Proposal based on Rule      l4a-8(i(7), as the Staff has consistently declined to      recommend enforcement action against companies that omitted      stockholder proposals requesting the Board of Directors to      hire or not to hire consultants, vendors, or suppliers.</p>
              <p>In <u>J.C. Penney Company, Inc</u>. (March      8, 1999), citing the proposal's implication of the      company&rsquo;s hiring practices, the Staff did not recommend      enforcement action against a company that omitted a proposal,      pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(7), prohibiting the company from      entering into &quot;personal service agreements&quot; with      retired employees.</p>
              <p>In <u>Bob Evans Farms, Inc</u>. (June 23,      1997), the Staff did not recommend enforcement action against      a company that omitted a proposal, pursuant to Rule      14a-8(c)(7) (predecessor to Rule 14a-8(i)(7)), calling for      the corporation&rsquo;s board of directors to consider and      select a consulting firm to advise the board and management      in order to make recommendations for improved financial      performance.</p>
              <p>In Release No. 34-40018 (May 21, 1998) the      Commission cited &quot;the degree to which a proposal seeks      to &lsquo;micro-manage&rsquo; the company by probing too deeply      into matters of a complex nature upon which shareholders, as      a group, would not be in a position to make an informed      judgment,&quot; as a second consideration for determining      whether a proposal relates to a company's ordinary business      operations.&quot; The Proposal aims to micro-manage the      process through which the Company will retain a proxy      advisory firm by specifying (i) selection through stockholder      vote, (ii) a time frame for implementation and (iii) a      ceiling ($10,000) on the amount the proxy advisory firm could      charge the Company.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                  <p><strong>THE PROPOSAL IS DESIGNED TO              PROMOTE THE PROPONENT&rsquo;S CONSULTING BUSINESS, A              BENEFIT NOT SHARED WITH THE COMPANY&rsquo;S              SHAREHOLDERS AT LARGE</strong></p>
                </blockquote>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The Proposal may be omitted under Rule      14a-8(i)(4), as it is intended as a springboard to launch the      Proponent&rsquo;s business of advising stockholders,      corporations and anyone else interested in visiting the      Proponent&rsquo;s website for information pertaining to      corporate governance. Under the guise of recommending that      stockholders select proxy advisory firms to be paid by      companies, the Proponent&rsquo;s supporting statement      concludes with information on his website and the various      articles that one might find there. This is, essentially, a      free advertisement to the Company&rsquo;s many stockholders.      Indeed, although it appears that the Proponent is not himself      a &quot;proxy advisory firm,&quot; his business of monitoring      and advising investors on corporate governance issues is      clearly linked to the business he champions in his Proposal.</p>
              <p>Although one might consider the Proposal      facially-neutral (except for the free advertisement at the      conclusion of the supporting statement) and beneficial to      other shareholders, the benefit to be gained by the Proponent      in advertising his website in Citigroup&rsquo;s proxy      statement is disproportionate to the possible benefit other      shareholders may derive. Accordingly, Citigroup submits that      this Proposal subverts the shareholder communications process      and may be omitted.</p>
              <p>The Commission has determined that it will      continue reviewing arguments predicated on Rule 14a-8(i)(4)      on a case-by-case basis (Rel. No. 34-40018). In <u>USLIFE      Income Fund, Inc</u>. (October 29, 1999), the Staff reviewed      an original proposal, an amended proposal, and a 13D filing      by the proponent and concluded that the proponent&rsquo;s      motive in submitting a proposal was to benefit itself and not      the company&rsquo;s shareholders at large.</p>
              <p>Citigroup submits that the Staff need not      read any further than the Proposal and supporting statement      to conclude that the intent of the Proposal is to benefit the      Proponent by maximizing stockholder exposure to the proxy      advisory business, a business in which the Proponent, as an      advisor on corporate governance issues, is a participant.</p>
              <blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                  <p><strong>THE PROPOSAL AND SUPPORTING              STATEMENT CONTAIN MISLEADING STATEMENTS, CONTRARY TO              THE COMMISSION&rsquo;S PROXY RULES, AND MAY BE OMITTED              UNDER RULE 14a-8(i)(3)</strong></p>
                  <p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
                </blockquote>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The framework for the Proposal is built on      unsupported assumptions, conclusory statements, and ambiguous      assertions that raise numerous questions as to (i) its      underlying rationale, (ii) what the Company would be required      to do should it be adopted and (iii) what thc stockholders      would be asked to vote on.</p>
              <p>First, the various clauses in the preamble      are conclusory statements without any factual basis. The      first clause makes the unsupported assumption that many      shareowners lack time and expertise to examine proxy issues      and are reluctant to follow management recommendations      because of &quot;possible contlicts of interest.&quot; No      studies, reports, articles, surveys or any other form of      evidentiary support is provided.</p>
              <p>The second clause, again unsupported and      conclusory, claims that &quot;proxy advisory firms have      established reputations for giving sound independent advice      to many institutional investors on how to vote their      shares,&quot; This suggests that every candidate willing to      pay &quot;an entry fee&quot; and offer its services for      &quot;no more than $10,000&quot; has established a reputation      for giving sound independent advice, a conclusion nowhere      supported. It does not set forth criteria which stockholders      could apply to distinguish among the candidates and make      their vote informative. Moreover, this assertion requires one      to infer that individual investors share the same interests      as institutional investors and, therefore, proxy advisory      firms are equally qualified to serve the investment interests      of both.</p>
              <p>Similarly, the Proposal is overly vague as      to what costs the Company might incur. The Proposal is silent      as to (i) whether the Company or the proxy advisory firm      would bear the mailing costs of providing the proxy advice to      the Company&rsquo;s stockholders, (ii) how frequently      communications to stockholders would be made, and (iii)      whether the Company would also bear the cost of printing the      materials mailed to stockholders. These are important      concerns that stockholders would need to evaluate in order to      determine the merits of the Proposal.</p>
              <p>Lacking any factual basis or evidentiary      support, the following assertions in the supporting statement      are conclusory and misleading and should not be included in      the Company&rsquo;s proxy statement under Rule 14a-9:      &quot;The Proposal can be expected to improve the return of      Citigroup stock by: enhancing management accountability to      shareowners by making professionally researched advice      available to all; effectively enfranchising individual      investors for the first time, ensuring that a majority of      shares can be voted independently of management&rsquo;s      recommendations; and encouraging greater competition among      advisory firms to serve shareowner interests.&quot;</p>
              <p>Citigroup submits that in view of the      prevalence of unsupported assumptions, conclusory statements      and ambiguous assertions, the Proposal and supporting      statement are materially misleading and should be omitted in      their entirety in accordance with Rule 14a-8(i)(3).</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="center"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
              <p>For the foregoing reasons, Citigroup      respectfully submits that the Proposal may be omitted      pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(7), Rule 14a8(i)(4), and Rule      14a-8(i)(3).</p>
