		      <p>Re: <em>Shareholder Proposal of James McRitchie and Myra      K. Young<br />
		        Securities Exchange Act of 1934 -- Rule 14a-8</em></p>
		      <p>Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>
		      <p>This letter is to inform you that Pfizer, Inc.      (&quot;Pfizer&quot; or the &quot;Company&quot;), intends to      omit from its proxy statement and form of proxy for its 2000      Annual Meeting of Stockholders (collectively, the &quot;2000      Proxy Materials&quot;) a shareholder proposal (the      &quot;Proposal&quot;) consisting of three recitals, a      resolution and a supporting statement received from James      McRitchie and Myra K. Young, Pfizer stockholders      (collectively, the &quot;Proponent&quot;).</p>
		      <p>The Proposal seeks to require that Pfizer hire a proxy      advisory firm, which is to be chosen by stockholder vote, for      one year. Under the terms of the Proposal, the stockholders      will vote to select the proxy advisory firm at the year 2001      shareowner meeting. Any proxy advisory firm may make itself      eligible for election by paying a nominal processing fee to      Pfizer according to the Proposal. The proxy advisory firm      that is selected by the stockholders then will provide proxy      analysis on all issues raised in connection with the year      2002 proxy materials. According to the Proposal, the fee for      services provided by the proxy advisory firm, not to exceed      $10,000, will be incurred by Pfizer. The Proposal requests      that Pfizer take &quot;all necessary steps&quot; to ensure</p>
		      <p>that the timetable for this process may be attained. The      Proponent&rsquo;s letter dated November 8, 1998, which sets      forth the Proposal and Supporting Statement, is attached to      this letter as Attachment A.</p>
		      <p>Pfizer hereby respectfully requests that the staff of the      Division of Corporation Finance (the &quot;Staff&quot;)      concur in its opinion that the Proposal may be excluded from      Pfizer&rsquo;s 2000 Proxy Materials on the bases set forth      below.</p>
		      <p>Pursuant to Rule 14a-8(j), enclosed are six (6) copies of      this letter and its attachments. Also in accordance with Rule      14a-8(j), a copy of this letter and its attachments is being      mailed on this date to the Proponents, informing them of      Pfizer&rsquo;s intention to omit the Proposal and the      Supporting Statement from the 2000 Proxy Materials. Pfizer      expects to mail its definitive 2000 Proxy Materials on March      15, 1999. Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 14a-8(j), this letter      is being filed with the Commission no later than 80 calendar      days before Pfizer files its definitive 2000 Proxy Materials      with the Commission.</p>
		      <p>As discussed more fully below, Pfizer believes the      Proposal and the Supporting Statement may properly be      excluded from the 2000 Proxy Materials pursuant to the      following provisions:</p>
		      <p>1. Rule 14a-8(i)(7), because the Proposal relates to      Pfizer&rsquo;s &quot;ordinary business operations&quot;;</p>
		      <p>2. Rule 14a-8(i)(8), because the Proposal relates to      election for membership to Pfizer&rsquo;s board of directors;</p>
		      <p>3. Rule 14a-8(i)(3) and Rule 14a-8(i)(6), because the      Proposal is vague and indefinite, it is therefore misleading,      and impossible to implement; and</p>
		      <p>4. Rule 14a-8(i)(l), because the Proposal is not a proper      subject for shareholder action under the laws of the State of      Delaware.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;</p>
		      <p><strong>I. </strong><strong><u>The Proposal May Be      Excluded under Rule 14a-8(i)(7) Because It Relates to      Pfizer&rsquo;s Ordinary Business Operations</u></strong></p>
		      <p>The Proposal may properly be omitted pursuant to Rule      14a-8(i)(7), which allows a company to exclude shareholder      proposals from its proxy materials &quot;if the proposal      deals with a matter relating to the company&rsquo;s ordinary      business operations.&quot; The express policy rationale      underlying Rule 14a-8(i)(7) is to &quot;confine the      resolution of ordinary business problems to management and      the board of directors, since it is impracticable for      shareholders to decide how to solve such problems at an      annual shareholders meeting.&quot; Exchange Act Release No.      40018 (May 21, 1998).</p>
		      <p>The instant Proposal is inexorably tied to Pfizer&rsquo;s      ordinary business operations. Four aspects of the Proposal      particularly impact the manner in which Pfizer conducts its      business:</p>
		      <p>(1) it restricts the ability of Pfizer&rsquo;s management      to decide how best to use corporate funds;(2) it undermines      Pfizer&rsquo;s authority to provide strategic and operational      advice; (3) it requires Pfizer to make supplemental      disclosures in its proxy materials that relate to ordinary      business matters; and (4) it limits Pfizer&rsquo;s ability to      manage the scheduling and mailing of the Company&rsquo;s proxy      materials.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;</p>
		      <p><strong>A. The Proposal Impedes Pfizer&rsquo;s Authority to      Decide How Best to Use Corporate Funds.</strong></p>
		      <p>The Proposal, if adopted, mandates that Pfizer hire a      proxy advisory firm, which may establish its fee for      services, not to exceed $10,000. Pfizer therefore would be      required to pay a fee to the proxy advisory firm for the      firm&rsquo;s services. In addition, the Proposal provides that      if the proxy advisory firm does not include its analysis in      the Company&rsquo;s proxy materials, then the analysis is to      be &quot;widely distributed&quot; and Pfizer is &quot;to take      all necessary steps&quot; to ensure this occurs. Accordingly,      Pfizer will be required to incur additional costs in the      event it has to &quot;widely distribute&quot; the proxy      advisory firm&rsquo;s analysis. Moreover, the additional      materials contemplated by the Proposal, including information      necessary to describe the proxy advisory firms on the ballot      in 2001, will make the proxy materials more lengthy and, as a      result, more costly. The cost incurred due to the volume of      the additional materials also will be borne by the Company.</p>
		      <p>Furthermore, because the advisory firm will not have a      &quot;business relationship&quot; with the Company&rsquo;s      stockholders and will be paid by the Company, the advisory      firm will not qualify for the exemption from the      Commission&rsquo;s proxy rules under Rule 14a-2(b)(3).      Therefore, if the proxy advisory firm supports the      recommendations of Pfizer&rsquo;s directors, then the proxy      advisory firm may be deemed a participant in the proxy      solicitation pursuant to Schedule 14A, Item 4 of the      Commission&rsquo;s rules, requiring disclosure of the      additional information required of participants under Item 4      and other provisions of Schedule 14A. If the proxy advisory      firm disagrees with the recommendations of Pfizer&rsquo;s      directors, the proxy advisory firm will be making a separate      solicitation and will have to prepare and file its own proxy      statement since the Company will not accept responsibility or      liability for the advisory firm&rsquo;s analysis or      recommendations.<a href="http://www.corpmon.com/PFEMgt19991221.htm#1">1</a> In such cases, Pfizer      would be forced to incur the substantial cost of printing and      mailing the proxy advisory firm&rsquo;s own solicitation and      ensuring it is &quot;widely distributed.&quot; Therefore, the      Proposal mandates that Pfizer incur an additional $10,000      expenditure in relation to the proxy materials, plus costs      incurred in relation to distributing the proxy firm&rsquo;s      analysis when the firm decides not to include its analysis in      the proxy materials, costs incurred for printing the more      voluminous proxy materials and costs incurred in relation to      the proxy advisory firm&rsquo;s own solicitation when      warranted by the Commission&rsquo;s rules.</p>
		      <p>Decisions about how to use corporate funds, including how      a company decides to communicate with its stockholders, are      quintessential ordinary course business decisions. See      generally Sonat, Inc. (Jan. 19, 1998) (finding a proposal      that directed the use of corporate funds to educational      institutions excludable under Rule 14a-8(i)(7)). More      specifically, the manner in which Pfizer expends,      distributes, invests and otherwise deploys corporate funds in      relation to the solicitation of proxy materials is an      important, ongoing responsibility of Pfizer&rsquo;s      management, under the direction of the Company&rsquo;s board      of directors. Indeed, the Staff has consistently found that      decisions relating to the manner in which a company      communicates with its shareholders are matters that squarely      relate to the registrant&rsquo;s ordinary business operations.      See, e.g., Nalco Chemical Co. (May 6, 1997) (finding a      proposal designed to reduce printing and distribution costs      by offering stockholders the option of receiving their      reports on-line, rather than in hard copy format was properly      excludable as a matter related to the company&rsquo;s ordinary      business operations); Montana Power Co. (January 28, 1991)      (finding a proposal to distribute a company&rsquo;s 10-K in      lieu of the annual report excludable &quot;since it deals      with a matter relating to the conduct of the Company&rsquo;s      ordinary business operations (i.e., decisions made with      respect to the cost and preparation techniques for the      Company&rsquo;s reports to shareholders).&quot;). Accordingly,      because the Proposal proscribes Pfizer&rsquo;s authority to      decide how best to use corporate funds to communicate with      stockholders, the Proposal may properly be omitted under Rule      14a-8(i)(7).</p>
		      <p>These letters are consistent with and not affected by the      Staffs position recently enunciated in Johnson Controls, Inc.      (Oct. 26, 1999). In Johnson Controls, the Staff announced      that henceforth it will analyze proposals requesting that      information be included in SEC filings by looking at the      underlying subject matter of the proposals. Here, the      underlying subject matter relates to the expenditure of      corporate funds. The Proposal also implicates the nature of      the Company&rsquo;s communications with its stockholders.      Thus, the Proposal is excludable because each of these      matters relates to ordinary business, regardless of whether      the advisory firm&rsquo;s analysis is disseminated through the      Company&rsquo;s proxy statement or otherwise &quot;widely      distributed.&quot;</p>
		      <p><strong>B. The Proposal Undercuts the Authority of      Pfizer&rsquo;s Management and Board of Directors to Provide      Advice on Strategic and Operational Decisions.</strong></p>
		      <p>The Proposal, if implemented, mandates the hiring of a      proxy advisory firm to provide advice to stockholders with      respect to all proxy questions. Proponent posits that this      Proposal will &quot;increase the likelihood that shareowners      add to Pfizer&rsquo;s knowledge base and its ability to      generate wealth.&quot; Yet, for Pfizer, a corporation      operating under Delaware law, the responsibility for the      day-to-day management of a corporation lies with its board of      directors and management. See Delaware General Corporation      Law &sect; 141(a); see also Exchange Act Release No. 40018 (May      21, 1998) (noting that ordinary business operations comprise      those tasks that &quot;are so fundamental to      management&rsquo;s ability to run a company on a day-to-day      basis that they could not, as a practical matter, be subject      to direct shareholder oversight&quot;). The hiring of the      proxy advisory firm itself, which is mandated by the      Proposal, thus runs counter to Delaware law and impinges on      the authority of Pfizer&rsquo;s directors to govern the      business and affairs of the Company.</p>
		      <p>More particularly, because the Proposal will allow the      proxy advisory firm to provide advice with respect to all      proxy questions, it follows that the proxy advisory firm will      offer advice on issues related to business strategy and      operation. Again, however, under Delaware law, it is the      board of directors&rsquo; responsibility to determine the      &quot;long-term strategic, financial and organizational goals      of the corporation&quot; and &quot;to approve formal or      informal plans for the achievement of these goals.&quot; C.L.      Grimes v. Donald, 20 Del. J. Corp. L. 757 (Del. Ch. 1995).</p>
		      <p>Matters related to general strategic and operational      decisions are well within the parameters of Pfizer&rsquo;s      ordinary business operations. Indeed, in analogous      situations, the Staff has repeatedly taken the position that      the registrant&rsquo;s board of directors is in the best      position to make recommendations with respect to general      business strategy and operational issues and excluded      proposals that impinge on this authority. For instance, in      Novametrix Medical Systems, Inc. (June 12, 1996), the Staff      considered a proposal to retain an investment bank that would      be tasked with evaluating the market valuation of the company      and suggesting a course of action based on this analysis. The      Staff concluded the proposal was properly excludable under      the ordinary business exclusion because it related to general      business strategy &ndash; a matter more appropriately handled      by the company&rsquo;s management and board of directors. See      also Bel Fuse, Inc. (April 24, 1991) (finding that a proposal      to retain an investment bank to explore strategic options for      the registrant properly excludable because it related to the      company&rsquo;s ordinary business operations); Integrated      Circuits, Inc. (December 27, 1988) (finding a proposal to      hire an investment bank to analyze the company and make      recommendations to enhance shareholder value excludable      because it related to the company&rsquo;s ordinary business      operations). Because the Proposal, if implemented, allows a      proxy advisory firm to issue advice on general business      strategy and operational issues, it impinges on the      responsibility of Pfizer&rsquo;s directors to manage the      business and affairs of the Company. Therefore, consistent      with the Staffs repeated guidance, the Proposal plainly may      be omitted from Pfizer&rsquo;s 2000 proxy materials pursuant      to Rule 14a-8(i)(7).</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;</p>
		      <p><strong>C. The Proposal Is Excludable under Rule      14a-8(i)(7) Because It Requires Pfizer to Make Supplemental      Disclosures in Its Proxy Materials that Involve Matters of      Ordinary Business.</strong></p>
		      <p>The Proposal, if adopted, will require the Company to      include in its 2001 Proxy Materials a ballot with all proxy      advisory firms that seek to advise Pfizer stockholders on      proxy issues. As a practical matter, this will require      inclusion of more than just a list of proxy firms; it will      require Pfizer to make supplemental disclosures in its proxy      materials that are related to ordinary business matters.</p>
		      <p>As noted earlier, the Staff recently determined in Johnson      Controls, Inc. (Oct. 26, 1999), that proposals requiring      additional disclosures in Commission-prescribed documents      will not automatically be omitted under Rule 14a-8(i)(7).      Instead, the Staff &quot;will consider whether the subject      matter of the additional disclosure sought in a particular      proposal involves a matter of ordinary business; where it      does, [the Staff] believe[s] it may be excluded under Rule      14a-8(i)(7).&quot; Johnson Controls, Inc. (Oct. 26, 1999).</p>
		      <p>Here, Pfizer will be required to make supplemental      disclosures as a result of the Proposal. For instance, as      part of the 2001 Proxy Materials, Pfizer will be forced to      include statements and appropriate disclosures about the fee      the proxy advisory firm will receive. Disclosures about the      processing fees that the proxy advisory firms pay to be      placed on the ballot will also have to be included in the      2001 Proxy Materials. In the year 2002 Proxy Materials, the      Proposal will require Pfizer to include the proxy      advisor&rsquo;s analysis on all proxy questions. As a result,      the Proposal will require Pfizer to include disclosures to      make clear that the analysis provided by the proxy advisory      firms is not that of management and does not constitute the      recommendations of Pfizer&rsquo;s board of directors.      Therefore, the Proposal, if implemented, will require Pfizer      to make supplemental disclosures in its proxy materials that      would not otherwise be required by any applicable laws or      regulations.</p>
		      <p>Applying the Johnson Controls analysis, the Proposal may      be omitted because the subject matter underlying the      supplemental disclosures described above relates to      Pfizer&rsquo;s ordinary business. First, Pfizer will have to      make satisfactory disclosures to clarify which      recommendations are those of its board of directors and which      are those of the proxy advisory firm. As described above in      Section I.B., the proxy advisory firm&rsquo;s ability under      the Proposal to offer advice on all proxy questions impinges      on the responsibility of Pfizer&rsquo;s directors to provide      recommendations to Pfizer stockholders and, hence, impedes      the ordinary business operations of the Company.</p>
		      <p>Second, the Proposal will require Pfizer to include      disclosures about the fee paid to the proxy advisory firm and      the processing fees paid by the firms to be placed on the      ballot. Again, decisions about how a company decides to use      corporate funds, especially in relation to solicitation of      proxies, are quintessential ordinary business decisions. See      Section I.A. Accordingly, because the subject matter      underlying the supplemental disclosures that will have to be      made if the Proposal is adopted relate to ordinary business      matters, the Proposal may be omitted under Johnson Controls      and Rule 14a-8(i)(7).</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;</p>
		      <p><strong>D. The Proposal Limits Pfizer&rsquo;s Authority to      Manage the Scheduling and Mailing of the Company&rsquo;s Proxy      Materials.</strong></p>
		      <p>As a practical matter, if the Proposal is implemented,      Pfizer would have to accommodate the advisory firm's review      and analysis in setting its own schedule. The Proposal states      that &quot;[t]he proxy advisory&rsquo;s analysis is to be      included with Pfizer&rsquo;s proxy materials for the year 2002      meeting or be otherwise widely distributed.&quot; If      implemented, this aspect of the Proposal raises a host of      practical considerations. For example, will Pfizer be able to      set a deadline in which to receive all proxy analysis from      the advisory firm? If so, assuming the advisory firm is      delinquent in providing its report, will Pfizer be able to      proceed with the Company&rsquo;s printing and distribution      schedule for its proxy materials notwithstanding the absence      of the advisory report? Who will incur the distribution costs      if the advisory firm decides to distribute its analysis in a      manner other than through the vehicle of the proxy materials?</p>
		      <p>These unanswered, as well as other unknowable, practical      considerations raised by the Proposal plainly will impact the      printing and mailing schedule for the 2002 Proxy Materials      and potentially even the 2001 Proxy Materials. The impact of      the Proposal in this respect runs counter to the Staff's      concurrence that a company&rsquo;s board of directors and      management is in the best position to determine the printing      and mailing schedule of proxy materials. See, e.g.,      Knight-Ridder, Inc. (February 5, 1991) (finding a proposal      that impacted the scheduling and mailing of proxy materials      properly omitted under the ordinary business exception).      Therefore, the Proposal may be excluded because its      inevitable impact on the printing and mailing schedule for      the proxy materials would interfere with Pfizer&rsquo;s      ordinary business operations.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;</p>
		      <p><strong>II. </strong><strong><u>The Proposal May Be      Excluded Because It Relates to Election for Membership on      Pfizer&rsquo;s Board of Directors</u></strong></p>
		      <p>The Proposal may be omitted from Pfizer&rsquo;s proxy      materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(8), which allows a      company to exclude a stockholder proposal where the proposal      &quot;relates to an election for membership on the      company&rsquo;s board of directors or analogous governing      body.&quot; The Commission has stated that &quot;the      principal purpose of [paragraph (i)(8)] is to make clear,      with respect to corporate elections that Rule 14a-8 is not      the proper means for conducting campaigns or effecting      reforms in elections of that nature, since the proxy rules,      including Rule 14a-11, are applicable.&quot; SEC Release No.      34-12598 (July 7, 1976).</p>
		      <p>By the terms of the Proposal, the proxy advisory firm that      is chosen by Pfizer stockholders will be asked to provide      analysis on all proxy-related issues between the 2001 and      2002 annual shareholder meeting. In this period, assuming the      number of directors constituting our board of directors      remains at fifteen, Pfizer will ask its stockholders to      elect, or re-elect, at least five individuals to its board.      The Proposal, if implemented, therefore requires the proxy      advisory firm to provide an opinion on the election of      specific nominees to Pfizer&rsquo;s board of directors.      Indeed, the Proposal even contemplates this role for the      proxy advisory firm chosen by the stockholders, suggesting in      its supporting statement that the Proposal &quot;is designed      to&hellip; stimulate shareholders to nominate board      members&hellip;&quot; While the Staff has not defined what      constitutes a &quot;contest&quot; for these elections, even      if the advisory firm is not supporting another candidate, but      is recommending a &quot;no&quot; vote or an abstention, the      advisory firm will be engaged in a solicitation in opposition      to management. As noted above, solicitations will not be      exempt under Rule 14a-2(b), nor, because there is no business      relationship between the advisory firm and the Company, for      example under Rule 14a-2(b)(1).</p>
		      <p>The Staff consistently has permitted the omission of      shareholder proposals that seek to establish procedures that      might affect or influence the nomination or election of      individual directors. For instance, in Amoco Corporation      (February 14, 1990), the Staff considered a proposal for a      common ballot procedure, wherein any stockholder with shares      representing over $100,000 in market value of the      registrant&rsquo;s shares could nominate an individual for      election to the registrant&rsquo;s board of directors.      Notwithstanding the general applicability of the proposal,      the Staff concluded it was properly excludable under Rule      14a-8(i)(8) because it could result in contested elections      for individual director slots.</p>
		      <p>Likewise here, the Proposal establishes a procedure that      is contemplated to result in solicitations both in favor and      against Pfizer&rsquo;s proposed directors. The Proposal      requires the proxy advisory firm elected by Pfizer      stockholders the opportunity to offer advice with respect to      all proxy questions, including the election of directors. It      is entirely possible that the opinions provided by the proxy      advisory firm with respect to the election of individual      directors will be contrary to the recommendations offered by      Pfizer&rsquo;s board of directors, thereby setting up a      contested election. As the Staff has repeatedly held,      however, there already is a mechanism under Rule 14a-11 of      the proxy rules to administer proxy contests.<a href="http://www.corpmon.com/PFEMgt19991221.htm#2">2</a> Accordingly, because the Proposal, if implemented, provides      for a proxy advisory firm to give advice with respect to the      election of individual Pfizer directors, it may be excluded      pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(8).</p>
		      <p>Furthermore, if other questions related to a Pfizer      director&rsquo;s suitability for office arise during the      applicable period, the proxy advisory firm is also required      under the terms of the Proposal to offer an opinion on this      issue. The Staff consistently views proposals that raise such      director-related issues as inextricably linked to the      election of directors and therefore properly excludable under      Rule 14a-8(i)(8). See Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea      Company, Inc. (March 8, 1996) (omission of a proposal      recommending that the board of directors censure the chief      executive); UAL Corporation (January 18, 1991) (omission of a      proposal calling for a vote of &quot;no confidence&quot; in      the company&rsquo;s board of directors); Time-Warner, Inc.      (March 23, 1990) (omission of a proposal seeking to censure      the company&rsquo;s directors). For these reasons also, the      instant Proposal may be excluded under Rule 14a-8(i)(8).</p>

		      <p><strong>III. </strong><strong><u>The Proposal May Be      Omitted under Rule 14a-8(i)(3) as It Is Vague and Indefinite,      and Therefore Misleading and, As A Result, under Rule      14a-8(i)(6) Because It Is Beyond Pfizer&rsquo;s Authority To      Effectuate</u></strong></p>
		      <p>The Proposal may be omitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(3)      as false and misleading because it is vague. A shareholder      proposal or supporting statement may be omitted under Rule      14a-8(i)(3) where it is &quot;contrary to any of the      Commission&rsquo;s proxy rules, including [Rule] 14a-9, which      prohibits materially false or misleading statements in proxy      soliciting materials.&quot; A proposal is sufficiently vague      and indefinite to justify its exclusion where &quot;neither      the shareholders voting on the proposal, nor the Company in      implementing the proposal (if adopted), would be able to      determine with any reasonable certainty exactly what actions      or measures the proposal requires.&quot; Philadelphia      Electric Co. (July 30, 1992). See also Bristol-Myers Squibb      Co. (Feb. 1, 1999) (proposal that Bristol-Myers Squibb      Company adopt policy &quot;not to test its products on unborn      children or cannibalize their bodies, but pursue      preservation, not destruction, of their lives&quot;      sufficiently vague to justify exclusion).</p>
		      <p>In addition, the Proposal may be omitted pursuant to Rule      14a-8(i)(6) because the Proposal is vague, with the result      that Pfizer &quot;would lack the power or authority to      implement&quot; it. A company &quot;lack[s] the power or      authority to implement&quot; a proposal where the proposal      &quot;is so vague and indefinite that [the company] would be      unable to determine what action should be taken.&quot;      Int&rsquo;l Business Machines Corp. (Jan. 14, 1992) (proposal      stating, without more, that &quot;[i]t is now apparent that      the need for representation has become a necessity&quot;      could be excluded under Rule 14a-8(i)(6) due to its      vagueness). The Proposal is so vague and indefinite in its      application and outcome that Pfizer would be unable to      determine what action should be taken to implement it.</p>
		      <p>The Proposal is vague in a number of respects, such that      Pfizer&rsquo;s stockholders, when voting on the Proposal, may      have differing views as to how the Proposal would be      implemented, and, if Pfizer were to seek to implement the      Proposal, the Company would not be certain what actions to      take. At the time of voting on the Proposal, neither Pfizer      nor its stockholders will know the nature of the advisory      services that are to be provided. Proxy advisory firms      provide a range of advisory services; sometimes voting advice      may be based on parameters and guidelines provided by their      clients, while other advice may be more generally provided to      all of the firm&rsquo;s clients based on standards the      advisory firm developed internally. Some firms will provide      either form of assistance but will charge different amounts      for their services. The Proposal here fails to specify the      manner in which the proxy advisory firm will be asked to      provide services. Not until after approval of the Proposal,      when the proxy advisory firms are asked to submit their      nomination proposals, would shareholders know the type of      services the advisory firm would provide under the Proposal.      Even then, the Company would not be able to determine whether      a specific proxy advisory firm&rsquo;s proposal to provide      services actually implements the Proposal. Nor does the      Proposal, on its face, address the scope of advice to be      provided by a firm. Instead, the advisory firm must      &quot;make its proxy analysis on Pfizer freely      available.&quot; Because of the vague reference to      &quot;proxy analysis on Pfizer,&quot; neither the      stockholders nor the Company will know whether the advisory      firm would be required to analyze a proposal initiated and      solicited by a third party in a proxy contest. For these      reasons, the Proposal is vague and therefore misleading and,      as a result, is impossible for the Company to implement.</p>
		      <p>Moreover, as noted above in Section I.D., the Proposal      impacts several practical considerations, yet provides no      ready answers for these concerns. For example, will Pfizer be      able to set a deadline in which to receive all proxy analysis      from the advisory firm? If so, assuming the advisory firm is      delinquent in providing its report, will Pfizer be able to      proceed with the Company&rsquo;s printing and distribution      schedule for its proxy materials notwithstanding the absence      of the advisory report? Who will incur the distribution costs      if the advisory firm decides to distribute its analysis in a      manner other than through the vehicle of the proxy materials?      The Staff has consistently omitted proposals as vague and      misleading when they fail to address essential aspects of how      the proposal is to be implemented. See, e.g. Houston      Industries, Inc. (March 28, 1990) (proposal relating to      annual election of directors vague because it fails to      specify a time period in which the proposal is to be      implemented). Accordingly, because the Proposal is so vague      that it leaves a host of unanswered questions regarding its      implementation, it may be omitted pursuant to Rule      14a-8(i)(3) and Rule 14a-8(i)(6).</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;</p>
		      <p><strong>IV. </strong><strong><u>The Proposal Is Not a      Proper Subject for Action Under the Laws of the State of      Delaware</u></strong></p>
		      <p>The Proposal may properly be omitted pursuant to Rule      14a-8(i)(1), which permits exclusion of a proposal if it is      &quot;not a proper subject for action by shareholders under      the laws of the jurisdiction of the company&rsquo;s      organization.&quot;</p>
		      <p>As a preliminary matter, the note to Rule 14a-8(i)(1)      provides that proposals cast as recommendations are typically      considered proper under state law. In the instant Proposal,      the Proponent fashions the resolution as a mandate such that,      if implemented, Pfizer must hire an advisory firm for one      year. The precatory language is absent and, hence, the      presumption of propriety under state law is also absent. More      importantly, as described below, the language in the Proposal      that requires Pfizer to hire a proxy advisory firm runs      counter to Delaware law.</p>
		      <p>Section 141(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law      provides that &quot;[t]he business and affairs of every      corporation &hellip; shall be managed by or under the direction      of the board of directors &hellip;&quot; Under the Proposal,      Pfizer must hire the proxy advisory firm chosen by the      shareholders, and the proxy advisory firm will then provide      advice to all stockholders with respect to all proxy      questions. This aspect of the Proposal effectively undermines      the ability of Pfizer&rsquo;s Board of Directors to manage the      business and affairs of the company. That is, one component      of a director&rsquo;s role is to provide recommendations to      the company&rsquo;s stockholders. By also allowing a proxy      advisory firm the opportunity to provide recommendations, the      Proposal places the proxy advisory firm in a quasi-managerial      role. As a result, the duty and obligation of Pfizer&rsquo;s      directors to make determinations and recommendations on      behalf of the Company would be undermined and potentially      contradicted by the advice offered by the proxy advisory      firm. See, e.g., Rockwell International Corp. (December 11,      1992) (concluding that a proposal that would require the      board to abdicate its fiduciary duty to manage the company      was excludable because it was deemed inappropriate for      shareholder action under state law). Such a result is plainly      contrary to the intent of Delaware law and, hence, is not an      appropriate subject for action by Pfizer stockholders.</p>

		      <p><strong>V. </strong><strong><u>The References to Web Sites      In the Supporting Statement May Be Omitted under Rule      14a-8(d)</u></strong></p>
		      <p>Finally, the Supporting Statement refers to the Corporate      Monitoring website (www.corpmon.com) for articles discussing      the company-pay system for proxy advice. Proponent&rsquo;s      citation to the Corporate Monitoring website incorporates by      reference the entire text of the site, which subverts the      intent of the 500-word limit of Rule 14a-8(d). Furthermore,      the citation is misleading because the data incorporated by      reference has not been furnished by either Pfizer or      Proponent. The reference to the site and its address      therefore may also be excluded from the 2000 Proxy Materials      pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(3). See Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.      (June 15, 1998).</p>
		      <p>For the reasons set forth in this letter, Pfizer      respectfully requests that the Staff concur in its opinion      that the Proposal may be excluded from Pfizer&rsquo;s 2000      Proxy Materials. Pfizer would be happy to provide you with      any additional information and answer any questions that you      may have regarding this subject. Should you disagree with the      conclusions set forth in this letter, we respectfully request      the opportunity to confer with you prior to the determination      of the Staffs final position. Please do not hesitate to call      the undersigned at (212) 733-4802, if you should need further      assistance in this matter.</p>
		      <p>&nbsp;</p>
		      <p>Respectfully,</p>

		      <p><a name="1" id="1">1</a> Rule 14a-8(l) allows a company to      disclaim responsibility for shareholder proposals, but an      issuer is not generally otherwise permitted to disclaim      responsibility for statements appearing in its proxy      materials.</p>
		      <p><a name="2" id="2">2</a> In this sense, because the Proposal      potentially runs afoul of the Commission&rsquo;s rule for      administering proxy contests, Rule 14a-11, Pfizer also      believes it may omit the Proposal under Rule 14a-8(i)(3),      which permits exclusion of a proposal that is contrary to any      of the Commission&rsquo;s proxy rules.</p>
