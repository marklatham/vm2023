		    <p><em>Proposal submitted to HRPT Properties on November 24, 2003 by shareowner Mark Latham:</em></p>
		    <hr />
		    <h3><strong>AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE BY SHAREOWNER  VOTE</strong></h3>
		    <blockquote>
              <p>WHEREAS auditor independence of management helps guarantee the integrity of     financial statements;</p>
		      <p>WHEREAS auditor selection by management may compromise auditor independence     of management;</p>
		      <p>THEREFORE HRPT Properties Trust shareowners request the Board of Trustees     to have the auditor selected annually by shareowner vote. To insulate auditor     selection from influence by HRPT Properties Trust management, any qualified     auditing firm could put itself on the ballot. Shareowners request the Board to     take all necessary steps to enact this resolution in time to hold the first     such vote at the year-2005 shareowner meeting.</p>
		      <p><u>Supporting Statement:</u></p>
		      <p><em>Wall Street Journal</em>, January 15, 2002:<br />
		        &ldquo;The accounting industry is in urgent need of     reform.<br />
		        The Enron fiasco is only the latest in a string of episodes involving Big 5     accounting firms in which outside auditors repeatedly blessed questionable     financial maneuvers -- until companies&rsquo; fortunes collapsed under mountains of     previously undisclosed debt and phony profits.&rdquo;</p>
		      <p><em>The Economist</em>, October 28, 2000:<br />
		        &ldquo;There is plenty of evidence that financial     statements often fail to come up to scratch. The number of companies restating     their accounts&mdash;never in ways that make them appear healthier&mdash;has been rising     so fast as to have become almost commonplace. Well-known firms whose audited     profits shrunk in a restatement include Waste Management, Sunbeam and CUC     International, during its merger with Cendant. Investors have lost billions of     dollars, and much of their faith in auditors.&rdquo;</p>
		      <p>In the current system, management chooses the auditor, and shareowners     merely rubber-stamp that choice. Under this proposal however, shareowners     would choose (by vote) among several auditing firms competing for the     position. This would encourage auditors to build their reputations in the eyes     of investors rather than in the eyes of management, creating new pressure for     higher standards. Investors could decide how important auditor independence is     to them, and how it should be assessed.</p>
		      <p>The average investor may seem ill-equipped to make such assessments on her     own. But she would not make them on her own. She would benefit from     consensus-building discussion by the entire investment community, including     proxy advisory firms. It is much easier to assess reputations of auditors than     of board members, because there are only a handful of auditing firms, versus     hundreds of board candidates for a diversified portfolio of stocks over the     years.</p>
		      <p>As with other voting matters, management would presumably make a     recommendation on which auditor to choose. Even if the management-recommended     auditor is never voted out, a rising percentage of opposition votes would     provide a healthy early warning to the auditor, that its reputation is     slipping and corrective action is required.</p>
		      <p>This is not to imply that there are accounting biases at HRPT Properties     Trust in particular, but no one knows when and where problems may occur. This     proposal would create a competitive market for auditor reputation. Investors     would gain the power and flexibility to determine standards of auditing     services that best meet their needs.</p>
