		    <h3><strong>VISTEON  BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION ON  THE</strong><strong> VOTING LEVERAGE PROPOSAL </strong><strong></strong><strong>IN 2004  PROXY</strong> STATEMENT </h3>

              <blockquote>
                  <p><em><strong>The Board of Directors Recommends that You Vote Against this       Proposal for the Reasons Set Forth Below: </strong></em></p>
                  <p>In our proxy statements, the Board of Directors provides Visteon&rsquo;s       stockholders with voting recommendations and information on which to make       voting decisions based on the Board&rsquo;s knowledge of the company and its       strategic plans as well as input from management and outside advisers. The       proposal described above requests that the Board study and report on the       feasibility of enabling stockholders to imitate an unspecified institutional       investor&rsquo;s voting decisions<strong><a href="20040512-VC-Board.html#1">1</a></strong> through the       proxy process. For the following reasons, we do not believe that there is       sufficient usefulness to stockholders to justify the time or expense of       conducting the requested study and report. Further, we believe, as a matter       of law, that the rules and regulations which govern proxy matters would       likely preclude ever utilizing the mechanism which we are being requested to       study.<strong><a href="20040512-VC-Board.html#2">2</a></strong> </p>
                  <p>As noted in the proposal itself, various institutional investors publish       their voting decisions on the Internet more than a week before the company&rsquo;s       voting deadline. The proposal even lists the specific websites where       stockholders can easily access those voting decisions. Besides these       websites, there are dozens of other sources with research data, analyses,       and other information regarding the company to assist the stockholders in       making their voting decisions. We believe that stockholders typically want       to read and understand the relevant information before making their voting       decisions. Accordingly, for those stockholders who may be inclined to       imitate any or all of the voting decisions of a particular institutional       investor, we suggest the most convenient and appropriate means would be to       simply access the relevant website and then complete the proxy as       recommended by that preferred investor. This process is simple, expedient,       and would give the stockholder any additional background it may need or want       to make an informed decision. Given this very convenient means that already       exists to be able to imitate an institutional investor&rsquo;s voting, we believe       incurring company time and expense to study the issue cannot be justified.<strong><a href="20040512-VC-Board.html#3">3</a></strong> </p>
                  <p>Because of its direct involvement in the oversight of the company, the       Board of Directors believes it is in the best position to make informed       recommendations to the company&rsquo;s stockholders with respect to the matters to       be voted on. That being said, to the extent any stockholder wishes to vote       its shares in line with a particular institutional investor, there already       exists a very convenient means of doing so that does not require further       diversion of corporate resources. </p>
                  <p><em><strong>For these Reasons, the Board of Directors Recommends that You Vote       Against this Proposal. </strong></em></p>

              <p><strong>PROPONENT'S RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE:</strong></p>
              <p><a name="1" id="1"><strong>1</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The Board study and   report could (and should) consider offering more than one choice of   institutional investor to imitate.&nbsp; The most convenient way to offer this   voting mechanism to shareowners is via the worldwide web.&nbsp; These ideas are   explained in the working paper <strong> <a href="http://www.corpmon.com/VoteYourStock.pdf">Vote Your Stock</a></strong>.</p>
              <p><a name="2" id="2"><strong>2</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Lawyers hired by Visteon   management (and paid with shareowners' money) made these arguments for omitting this proposal from the proxy in   their January 7, 2004 letter to the SEC:<br />
                - &quot;The Proposal violates Delaware law and therefore may be omitted under Rule   14a-8(i)(2).&quot;<br />
                - &quot;The Proposal violates the proxy rules and therefore may be excluded under   Rule 14a-8(i)(3).&quot;</p>
              <p>However, the SEC Division of Corporation Finance, Office of Chief Counsel   found those arguments unpersuasive.&nbsp; In their February 19, 2004 response   letter:<br />
                - &quot;We are unable to concur in your view that Visteon may exclude the proposal   under rule 14a-8(i)(2).&quot;<br />
                - &quot;We are unable to concur in your view that Visteon may exclude the entire   proposal under rule 14a-8(i)(3).&quot;<br />
                That is why the proposal is now in the Visteon proxy.</p>
              <p><a name="3" id="3"><strong>3</strong></a><strong>.</strong> For many shareowners,   especially individual investors, the degree of convenience matters a great deal.&nbsp;   Individual investors are not legally required to vote their stock, so many of   them don't bother.&nbsp; And most who do vote, simply follow the Board's   conveniently displayed recommendations.&nbsp; This proposal would help level   that biased playing field.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
