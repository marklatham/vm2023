		    <p><em>Submitted to Oakwood Homes on September 3, 2002 by  shareowner Mark Latham:</em></p>
		    <hr />
		    <h3><strong> PROXY ADVISOR PROPOSAL </strong></h3>
		    <blockquote>
              <p>WHEREAS many shareowners lack     the time and expertise to make the best voting decisions, yet prefer not to     always follow directors&rsquo; recommendations, because of possible conflicts of     interest;</p>
		      <p>WHEREAS shareowners have a     common interest in obtaining sound independent advice, but often insufficient     private interest to justify paying for it individually (the &ldquo;free-rider&rdquo;     problem);</p>
		      <p>THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that     Oakwood Homes Corporation shareowners request the Board of Directors to hire a     proxy advisory firm for one year, to be chosen by shareowner vote.&nbsp;     Shareowners request the Board to take all necessary steps to enact this     resolution in time to hold the vote at the year-2004 shareowner meeting, with     the following features:</p>
		      <blockquote>
		        <p> &middot;&nbsp;    To insulate advisor selection from influence by Company     management, any proxy advisory firm could put itself on the ballot by paying     an entry fee, declaring the price (no more than $8000) for advisory services     for the coming year, and providing the address of a website describing their     proposed services and qualifications.</p>
		        <p> &middot;&nbsp;    The winning candidate would be paid its declared price by the     Company, and make advice freely available to all Company shareowners for the     subsequent year, on all matters put to shareowner vote except director     elections.&nbsp; This advice could relate to such matters as mergers, stock option     plans, and shareowner proposals.&nbsp; (Advice on director elections is excluded to     satisfy SEC rule 14a-8(i)(8).)</p>
		        <p> &middot;&nbsp;    Performance of the advisory firm would not be policed by Company     management, but rather by gain or loss of the advisor&rsquo;s reputation and future     business.</p>
		        <p> &middot;&nbsp;    Brief summary advice could be included in the Company proxy,     with references to a website and/or a toll-free phone number for more detail.</p>
		        <p> &middot;&nbsp;    The decision of whether to hire proxy advisory firms in later     years would be left open.</p>
	          </blockquote>
		      <p><u>Supporting Statement:</u></p>
		      <p>The proxy advisor would be     paid with Company funds to give shareowners an independent professional     opinion.&nbsp; Independence would be further enhanced by having shareowners choose     the proxy advisor.&nbsp; This could also increase competition in the proxy advisory     business, because new entrants could earn fees on a company-by-company basis,     without covering thousands of companies.</p>
		      <p>From the <em>Wall Street     Journal</em> (July 26, 2001) article entitled &ldquo;After This Deal, Is Anyone Left     to Give Advice?&rdquo;: &lsquo;&hellip;Proxy Monitor Inc. has agreed to buy Institutional     Shareholder Services&hellip; A monopoly of shareholder advice doesn&rsquo;t sit well with     some. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like going to a doctor and then wanting to get a second opinion,     but there is no second opinion. It&rsquo;s a very serious matter,&rdquo; said Mark     Schwarz, an activist shareholder and founder of hedge fund Newcastle Partners     LP. &hellip; [ISS] analyzes proxies and issues voting recommendations for more than     9,000 U.S. and 10,000 non-U.S. shareholder meetings each year.&rsquo;</p>
		      <p>The conflicts of interest     among managers, directors and shareowners are described in Robert Monks and     Nell Minow&rsquo;s 1996 book <em>Watching the Watchers</em>, along with shareowners&rsquo;     &ldquo;free rider&rdquo; and &ldquo;rational ignorance&rdquo; problems.</p>
