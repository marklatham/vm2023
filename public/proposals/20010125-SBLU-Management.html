	          </blockquote>
		      <p>Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>
		      <p>SONICblue Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the      &quot;Company&quot;), hereby requests that the staff of the      Division of Corporate Finance (the &quot;Staff&quot;) of the      Securities and Exchange Commission (the &quot;SEC&quot;) not      recommend any enforcement action if the Company excludes a      proposal (the &quot;Proposal&quot;) submitted by Mark Latham      (the &quot;Proponent&quot;) from the Company&rsquo;s Proxy      Statement that will be distributed in connection with the      Company&rsquo;s 2001 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Pursuant      to Rule 14a-8(j) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934      (the &quot;Exchange Act&quot;), we are enclosing six copies      of this letter and of the letter from the Proponent dated      November 24, 2000 and received by the Company on December 6,      2000, setting forth the Proposal, including the attachments      thereto.</p>
		      <p>The Company has asked us to advise you that it intends to      omit the Proposal from its 2001 Proxy Statement. It has      decided to do so because of our advice that the Company may      exclude the Proposal based on any one of the following four      grounds:</p>
		      <blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>1. It violates Rule 14a-8(i)(7) because the              Proposal deals with the method of selecting the              Company&rsquo;s independent auditors, a matter              relating to the Company&rsquo;s ordinary business              operations.</p>
                  <p>2. It violates Rule 14a-8(i)(1) because the              Proposal concerns a subject upon which stockholders              may not properly take action under the laws of the              State of Delaware, the Company&rsquo;s state of              incorporation.</p>
                  <p>3. It is so vague and indefinite as to be              materially misleading under Rule 14a-9 and thus              subject to exclusion under Rule 14a-8(i)(3).</p>
                  <p>4. It violates Rule 14a-8(i)(10) because the              Proposal has been substantially implemented by the              Company.</p>
                </blockquote>
	          </blockquote>
		      <p><u>Discussion</u></p>
		      <p><strong>1. The Proposal concerns a matter dealing with the      Company&rsquo;s ordinary business operations, and, therefore,      may be excluded under Rule 14a-8(i)(7).</strong></p>
		      <p>Rule 14a-8(i)(7) states that a stockholder proposal may be      excluded if it deals with a matter relating to the      company&rsquo;s ordinary business operation. Under Rule      14a-8(i)(7) it is solely within the purview of management to      submit such proposals for stockholder approval. The Proposal      mandates that the stockholders annually select the      Company&rsquo;s independent auditors. The Staff has previously      affirmed that stockholder proposals relating to the manner in      which independent auditors are chosen may be excluded as      relating to matters reserved for management. In a no-action      letter issued to <u>Community Bancshares, Inc</u>. (March 15,      1999), the Staff did not recommend enforcement action with      respect to the registrant&rsquo;s decision to omit a      stockholder&rsquo;s proposal because the proponent attempted      to change the manner in which that company&rsquo;s auditors      were selected. The proponent desired that the company amend      its bylaws to require that an audit committee be established      to choose the company&rsquo;s auditors from a group meeting      specified criteria. As with the Proposal at issue, the      auditor selection proposal in <u>Community Banchshares</u> dealt with a routine management matter&mdash;a matter reserved      for the Board. In a number of other recent no-action letters      the Staff has taken the position that a company&rsquo;s      ordinary business operations include the selection of      independent auditors. <em>See, e.g., </em><u>Excalibur      Technologies Corporation</u> (May 4, 1998); <u>Occidental      Petroleum Corporation</u> (December 11, 1997); <u>Transamerica      Corporation</u> (March 8, 1996) (stockholder proposal may be      omitted where proposal relates to the method of and selection      of the company&rsquo;s independent auditors).</p>
		      <p>The Company respectfully submits that the selection of      auditors is a routine management matter. In conducting the      Company&rsquo;s ordinary business operations, the      Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors would consider, based on      the recommendation of the Board&rsquo;s Audit Committee, a      number of factors in determining whether to change its      independent auditors. Such factors may include, without      limitation, auditor expertise, including international      capabilities, as well as management and employee time and      resources in working with new auditors and the time and      expense required for auditors to acquaint or reacquaint      themselves with the Company and its procedures. Because of      the need to evaluate these and other factors, it is      reasonable that the selection of auditors fall within the      purview of the Board as part of the Company&rsquo;s ordinary      business operations.</p>
		      <p>In addition, pursuant to Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(d),      the Company&rsquo;s Audit Committee must consist of at least      three directors who are independent of the Company&rsquo;s      management and who must be able to read and understand      financial statements. Rule 4350(d) also requires each      Nasdaq-listed company to adopt a written audit committee      charter which must specify, among other things, &quot;the      outside auditor&rsquo;s ultimate accountability to the board      of directors and the audit committee, as representatives of      [stock]holders, and these [stock]holder representatives&rsquo;      ultimate authority and responsibility to select, evaluate,      and, where appropriate, replace the outside auditor (or to      nominate the outside auditor to be proposed for [stockholder      approval in any proxy statement).&quot; The charter must also      include guidelines as to the audit committee&rsquo;s      responsibility for overseeing the independence of the outside      auditor.</p>
		      <p>As discussed in part 4 below, the Company submits the      appointment of its independent auditors for confirmation by      the stockholders at its annual meeting. The Nasdaq audit      committee provisions place responsibility for selecting the      auditors, or at least nominating the auditors for stockholder      approval, on the board of directors and the audit committee.      Therefore, since the Proposal at issue would allow &quot;any      qualified auditing firm&quot; to &quot;put itself on the      ballot,&quot; as stated in paragraph 3 of the Proposal, it      would conflict with the Board and the Audit Committee&rsquo;s      conduct of ordinary business operations, including      overseeing, changing, selecting or recommending auditors, as      required under the Nasdaq rules.</p>
		      <p>2. <strong>The Proposal concerns a matter that under Delaware      law is not a proper subject for stockholder action, and,      therefore, may be excluded under Rule 14a-8(i)(1).</strong></p>
		      <p>Rule 14a-8(i)(1) provides that a company may exclude a      stockholder proposal if the proposal concerns a subject that      is not a proper subject for stockholder action under the laws      of the company&rsquo;s state of incorporation. Traditionally,      the Staff has taken the interpretative view that the Board      has exclusive discretion in corporate matters, unless a      specific provision in a state&rsquo;s corporate code, or the      corporation&rsquo;s charter or bylaws states otherwise. <em>See </em>Securities and Exchange Act Release No. 34-12999      (November 22, 1976); <em>see also, </em><u>Pay Less Drug Stores</u> (April 11, 1975) (stockholder proposal may be omitted where      California Corporations Code does not specifically provide      for stockholder decisions regarding selection of the      company&rsquo;s independent auditors).</p>
		      <p>The Company&rsquo;s state of incorporation is Delaware. No      provision in the Company&rsquo;s bylaws, its Certificate of      Incorporation, or the Delaware General Corporation Law      (&quot;DGCL&quot;) vests the stockholders with the power to      choose the Company&rsquo;s independent auditors. To the      contrary, under Section 141(a) of the DGCL the board of      directors manages the corporate affairs of the corporation:      &quot;[t]he business and affairs of every corporation...      shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of      directors, except as may be otherwise provide in this chapter      or in its certificate of incorporation.&quot; Section 122(5)      of the DGCL further provides that the corporation may appoint      officers and agents as business requirements dictate:      &quot;[e]very corporation . . . shall      have the power to . . . (5) [a]ppoint      such officers and agents as the business of the corporation      requires and to pay or otherwise provide for them suitable      compensation.&quot;</p>
		      <p>The Staff has previously concurred with the position that      where a state&rsquo;s corporate code vests the company with      the power to choose corporate agents, the company may omit      stockholder proposals dealing with the manner of auditor      selection as encroachments on Board authority. <em>See </em><u>Pay      Less Drug Stores</u> (April 11, 1975). In a no-action letter      issued to <u>Pay Less Drug Stores</u>, the Staff refrained      from taking enforcement action with respect to the      registrant&rsquo;s decision to omit a stockholder&rsquo;s      proposal because the proposal requested that a stockholder      nominate the company&rsquo;s auditors. There, the registrant      cited a California Corporations Code Section that vested      corporations with the power to &quot;[appoint such      subordinate officers or agents as its business may      require....&quot; As noted above, the DGCL utilizes analogous      language to empower the Board to select corporate agents.      Thus, the Proposal at issue runs afoul of Delaware law just      as the stockholder proposal in <u>Pay Less Drug Stores</u> failed to conform to California law.</p>
		      <p>We respectfully submit that absent any provision in the      DGCL, the Company&rsquo;s Bylaws or its Certificate of      Incorporation, the Board of Directors holds the exclusive      power to select independent auditors.</p>
		      <p><strong>3. The Proposal is vague and indefinite so as to be      materially false and misleading under Rule 14a-9 and,      therefore, may be excluded under Rule 14a-8(i)(3).</strong></p>
		      <p>Rule 14a-8(i)(3) states that a corporation may exclude      proposals that are contrary to any of the SEC&rsquo;s proxy      rules, including materially false or misleading statements in      proxy soliciting materials. The Staff has previously taken      the position that proposals deemed vague and indefinite are      misleading under Rule 14a-9 and, therefore, excludable under      Rule 14a-8(i)(3). <em>See </em><u>Connecticut Natural Gas      Corporation</u> (November 29, 1993). In a no-action letter      issued to <u>Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation</u>, the      Staff did not recommend enforcement action with respect to      the registrant&rsquo;s decision to omit a stockholder&rsquo;s      proposal because the proposal was ambiguous as to the      criteria for selection of the auditors, the voting process by      which the auditors should be chosen, and the effect the      proposal would have on the board as a result of an      affirmative vote. As in <u>Connecticut Natural Gas      Corporation</u>, the Company would be incapable of      implementing this Proposal if it were approved.</p>
		      <p>The Proposal is vague and indefinite as to auditor      selection standards and voting procedures. The proponent in <u>Connecticut      Natural Gas Corporation</u> failed to address the standards      for choosing auditors. Similarly, the Proponent here has not      provided criteria for selection of auditors or provided for      the manner in which auditors might appear on the ballot. The      Proponent states merely that any &quot;qualified&quot;      accounting firm could place itself on the ballot. However,      the Company&rsquo;s business requires the services of an      accounting firm with sophisticated knowledge and experience,      including international capabilities. It is not clear from      the Proposal whether &quot;qualified&quot; entails only      members of the &quot;big five&quot; accounting firms or any      national accounting firm. Further, in order to qualify, must      the Company&rsquo;s Audit Committee first evaluate and      interview the candidates? If not, the Company would not be in      compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 43 50(d), as      explained in part 1 above.</p>
		      <p>The proposal in <u>Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation</u> also failed to provide rules for the balloting. Here, too,      the Proposal fails to describe the voting process by which      the auditor would be chosen. Is a majority vote sufficient?      Or, in the event that three or more firms are presented on      the ballot, is a plurality sufficient? Section 216 of the      DGCL, in conjunction with the Company&rsquo;s Certificate of      Incorporation and Bylaws, provides that stockholder action,      other than the election of directors, be by affirmative vote      of a majority of the shares present or represented at the      meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter.      Therefore, a plurality would not constitute action by the      stockholders. If a majority vote is required, what happens if      no firm receives such a vote on the first ballot? May a proxy      holder cast his or her vote for another choice on a second      ballot? If not and absent any other procedure, the Proposal      could result in the Company having <u>no</u> auditors.</p>
		      <p>The Company respectfully submits that such deficiencies      present insuperable ambiguities in the Proposal, rendering it      so vague and indefinite as to violate Rule 14a-9&rsquo;s      prohibition against false and misleading statements in proxy      soliciting materials.</p>
		      <p><strong>4. The Proposal concerns a matter that has been      substantially implemented, and, therefore, may be excluded      under Rule 14a-8(i)(10).</strong></p>
		      <p>Rule 14a-8(i)(10) states that a corporation may exclude      proposals that the corporation has already substantially      implemented. It is the Company&rsquo;s practice to include for      consideration in its proxy statement a proposal for the      confirmation of the appointment of its independent auditors,      as selected by the Board of Directors based on the      recommendation of the Audit Committee. The Company included      such a proposal last year and anticipates that it will      continue to include confirmation of the appointment of its      independent auditors in each annual meeting of stockholders.</p>
		      <p>The essence of the Proposal is to allow stockholders to      select auditors to ensure auditor independence of Company      management. <em>See </em>paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Proposal.      The Company, as noted in part 1 of this letter and required      by the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules, has an Audit Committee which      consists of independent directors, oversees the      Company&rsquo;s independent auditors and recommends the      selection of auditors to the Board of Directors. The SEC has      also addressed issues of auditor independence in its      amendments to Section 2-01 of Regulation S-X and Item 9 of      Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act. As companies comply with      the amended Item 9, the additional disclosure will provide      further information to stockholders as they consider whether      to confirm or ratify appointments of independent auditors.      The Proposal&rsquo;s essential purpose of permitting      stockholder voting as to auditors while ensuring auditor      independence of Company management is substantially      implemented by the Company&rsquo;s compliance with the Nasdaq      provisions, the SEC auditor independence provisions and the      submission of the auditors&rsquo; appointment for confirmation      by the vote of the stockholders.</p>
		      <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
		      <p>For the aforementioned reasons, we respectfully request      the Staff not recommend any enforcement action to the SEC if      the Company omits the Proposal from its 2001 Proxy Statement.      Please time-stamp and return a copy of this letter to us in      the enclosed preaddressed, pre-paid envelope. By a copy of      this letter, we are also notifying the Proponent of the      Company&rsquo;s intention to omit the Proposal from its proxy      materials for the Company&rsquo;s 2001 Annual Meeting of      Stockholders. We further request that the Proponent copy the      undersigned on any response the Proponent files with the SEC.      The Company intends to release definitive copies of its proxy      materials to stockholders on or about April 17, 2001.</p>
		      <p>If the Staff disagrees with our conclusions or our      requests on behalf of the Company or if the Staff requires      any additional information in support of our position, we      would appreciate an opportunity to confer with you prior to      the issuance of your response. If you have any questions      regarding any aspect of this request, please call me at (650)      233-4706, or in my absence, David Gershon, General Counsel of      the Company, at (408) 588-8968.</p>
